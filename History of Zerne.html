Early in my youth, I decided to write a history of my homeland.             
However, one needs information to complete this task. I hoped to find             
this in the archives of the community, the parish rectory, the estate             
of Count Csekonics, and the mother community of Hatzfeld.             
Unfortunately, my efforts were fruitless. So I gave up searching for             
old documents and devoted myself to the collection of the memories of             
older fellow countrymen. In this way, I received many a valuable             
communication of personal memories from the people involved and oral             
records passed down from settlement times. I examined the collection of             
materials carefully, and this first became useful when, in 1943, I had             
to submit a history of the community at the request of higher             
authorities. Before this time, I had already been given the opportunity             
to verify and complete my collection of materials from similar             
publications to the extent that it was necessary for our community.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
After the stirring events of World War II and the period thereafter, it             
occurred to me again that I should write down the details of events and             
not let them be forgotten. This was quite a task that required great             
commitment and much dedication, but it brought me closer to my goal. My             
fellow countryman, Josef Kampf, with his female colleagues, was also             
involved. Additional valuable material was provided by Jakob Nickels,             
our last vice-notary, Anton Kampf, and my countryman, Matthias Kampf of             
Hatzfeld. To them and to all who put themselves at our disposal or in             
other ways cooperated for the completion of this book, my heartfelt             
thanks.</font><br>
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The             
goal of this work is to provide the youth and succeeding generations an

also keep alive the thoughts and remembrances of their ancestors.</font><br>

Our former homeland was the Banat. It lies in the southern part of the             
Pannonian lowland plain between the Danube River, the Theiss, Marosch,             
and Siebenburg Mountains. It has a surface of 28,000 qkm <i>[quadratkilometers             
or square kilometers]</i>. The population before World War I was 1.5             
million.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The land is flat in the west, rolling, and             
mountainous in the east. The history of the Banat is very changeable.             
No doubt, the Romans walked the lands of our homeland, and there were             
Roman legions stationed there after they conquered Decebal, the king of             
Dacia, and made the Siebenburgs a Roman province.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the great migrations, which shook the empire             
of the Romans to their foundations, Goths, Gepids, and Vandals marched             
through this region. In the year 375 it was under the command of the             
Huns, who founded a great empire under their king Attila (Etzel) that             
fell into ruin after Attila’s death. Lombards and later Avars succeeded             
the Huns. The latter were totally vanquished by Karl the Great.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 896 A.D., the Hungarians (Magyars) conquered the             
Banat. They took possession of the land within the Carpathians,             
overthrew the resident tribes, and founded a permanent abode there. It             
did not all go smoothly. They harassed the neighboring nations. They             
led raids into other countries. The tribal princes were always fighting             
among themselves. Under the first king, Stefan the Holy, the Magyars             
were converted to Christianity and more peaceful and more favorable             
times followed for the country.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;However, the dangers from outside had no end.             
The incursion of the Cumans and the march of the crusaders through the             
land caused terrible devastation. Scarcely had the first sign of             
improvement appeared when the troops of the Greek emperor Manuel             
destroyed our homeland.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1242, the Mongols broke out of Asia, invaded             
Hungary and the Banat, and devastated it completely. Hungarian king             
Béla IV himself had to flee. After the departure of these wild hordes,</font></p>

was a picture of total devastation. Only slowly did the people who             
endured this destruction venture out of their hiding places. A small             
number survived this sudden and cruel invasion and began reconstruction.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The population had only slowly multiplied before a             
new threat arose. The Turks from Asia, having invaded and conquered the             
lands of the Balkan Peninsula (1389 Battle of Amselfeld), also invaded             
the Banat and brought in the plague. The already sparse population was             
newly decimated. In 1526, the Hungarian king Ludwig II suffered an             
annihilating defeat at Mohács, and the Turks pressed forward their             
advantage. Their goal was the conquest of Vienna. Only with the help of             
the Polish king Jan Sobieski could they be repelled from this siege in             
1683. Now came a turning point in the long battle against the Turks.             
Finally, in 1686, Ofen (Budapest) was re-conquered, and there followed             
the liberation of the territories subjugated by the Turks. The             
triumphant battles of Prince Eugen von Savoy at Zenta (1697) and             
Temesvar, and the ensuing conclusion of peace at Passarovitz (1718),             
finally delivered the Banat from the Turks. A setback occurred once             
more in 1737 with a new outbreak of the Turkish War. To protect the             
boundaries from the Turks, so-called military borders were established;             
these borders were colonized by military farmers. Their task was to             
protect the land from the constant Turkish invasions.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What did the Banat look like after the Turkish             
dominion?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where there had once been flourishing villages             
before the Turkish rule, now were only ruins and leftover rubble,             
fruitful fields overgrown by wilderness. Weed, cane, brushwood, and             
forest grew over everything. Here every kind of beast of prey, wolves,             
wild hogs, and birds of prey found shelter. Rivers overflowed their             
banks, changed their course. Puddles and wild watercourses arose. The             
land became marsh. The marsh formed a breeding place for harmful             
insects. The vapors were not healthy. The inhabitants were nomadic Slav             
herders who lived in caverns. The land was very sparsely settled. It             
made sense, therefore, to colonize it and bring it into cultivation.             
The first governor of the Banat was Count Claudius Florimund Mercy. His             
first task was to transform the fallow lands into fruitful farmland             
through the settlement of colonists. He had the land surveyed and had             
the Bega canal built so that the extensive lands were drained.&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Then he allowed settlers to

setback in the colonization. Many settlers fled. Others became victims             
of pestilence.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second large settlement occurred under the reign             
of Maria Theresa. These were Catholic Germans from the German Empire             
and, to a smaller extent, French from Alsace-Lorraine.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What induced the settlers to leave their homeland?             
When it became known that the empress had issued the “Charter of             
Colonization" (<i>"Kolonisierungs-Patent”</i>) in 1763, recruiters and             
agents were drawn throughout the land to enlist settlers. The             
recruitment had good results, especially in the southwestern area of             
Germany. The settlers were granted an allocation of land, home sites, a             
fee allotment of timber and firewood, and freedom from taxation for 6             
years. Craftsmen received freedom from taxation for 10 years. For the             
journey, the colonists received daily travel expenses based on the             
number of family members. The difficult trip into the Banat went             
through Ulm, Regensburg to Vienna. Here they received the charters and             
travel money to Ofen (Budapest) and from there, additional travel money             
to the Banat. The offer was enticing and the decision to move as             
settlers to distant Hungary, into the Banat, alleviated problems in             
their homeland at that time. Due to many wars, the people were             
impoverished, the tax burdens were huge, the tariffs high, and likewise             
the rents. The chicanery of civil servants was no less troublesome. All             
these things together promoted the decision for emigration.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although many incentives were given which             
favored and led to the decision of the colonists, there still followed             
a difficult farewell. Everything that was beloved and dear to them up             
until then had to be left behind. Sons, daughters, brothers, sisters,             
good friends, or neighbors remaining at home were forlorn. The settlers             
felt the pain of separation twice, for not only did they leave behind             
their loved ones, but also the homeland that had always given them much             
beauty and much joy. Many private tears were shed before the trip for             
they knew the separation could be forever.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So they set out upon their laborious journey. A             
murderous climate and wilderness awaited them upon their arrival in the             
Banat. With unparalleled courage and diligence, they took on the&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">battle, and <br>

Since the Banat had been freed from the Turks with a huge sacrifice of             
blood in the victorious campaigns of Prince Eugen, there was a question             
about the security of the regained possession. Even when the Turks had             
been forced back into the area lying south of the Danube, there were             
still constant raids by smaller Turkish troops along the borders. To             
prevent this, and to enable peaceful development in these possessions,             
proper measures had to be taken.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This led to the decision to settle soldiers as             
farmers along the boundaries in a wide border patrol. Their task was to             
avert the smaller Turkish raids as defense farmers and, as such, they             
were under the command of their border regiments. Special privileges             
were granted to them. This border patrol was known as the military             
frontier.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, even larger troops had to be stationed in             
the northern areas for they had to reckon with the problem of much more             
adverse invasions.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The larger troop federations required a large amount             
of provision, war materials, equipment, and other things. These often             
had to be procured from distant territories of the empire with great             
difficulty and effort. So arose the plan for the settlement of the             
Banat.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first settlers who received land were veterans,             
members of the baggage train, and camp followers. Next came thousands             
of settlers, mainly from the southwestern part of the empire.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By these two measures, establishment of the military             
border and settlement and cultivation of the Banat, the security and             
provisions for the army were guaranteed not only for the present but             
also for the future.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connected to the settlement were the following

      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Empress Maria Theresa.</b> The largest portion             
of settlement occurred under her time of reign. Over 50,000 families             
established themselves in the barely populated territories of southern             
Hungary. They took upon themselves the development of their lands and             
strengthened the Germans. The objective was a united state. She limited             
enforced labor, implemented freedom of the farmers to own property,             
supported trade and industry, and ordered the opening of schools for             
the people. During her reign, only Catholic settlers were allowed. In             
gratitude for the help of the Hungarians in the Seven Years War             
(1756-1763), she granted them certain privileges. The Hungarian             
language became the administrative language in the Banat, which was to             
the disadvantage of the German people.<br>             
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Josef II.</b> He permitted the settlement of             
Protestants in the Banat, abolished serfdom, and granted his subjects             
freedom of speech and freedom of the press, for which he received the             
name “Josef the German”. His objective was a monolingual united state.             
To the woe of the German settlers and the placation of the Hungarians,             
he withdrew all of his reform measures on his deathbed.<br>             
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Prince Eugen von Savoy.</b> “The noble knight”

a well-educated, religious and art-loving man, one of the greatest             
personalities of his era, a triumphant general and a great statesman.<br>             
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>General Count Claudius Florimund Mercy.</b> He             
was the first governor of the Banat. Under his direction,             
reconstruction of the Banat was most seriously pursued. He had the             
canalization of the Banat completed, resulting in a decline of the             
dreaded swamp fever (malaria) that had previously taken thousands of

In the year 1753, 68 Serbians, among them a few Romanian families, came             
into the territory of our homeland community as settlers from Boldur             
Ried, which they left because of the constant threat of flooding.             
Boldur Ried was in the vicinity of the future village of             
Deutsch-Sankt-Michael in today’s Romanian Banat, near the community of             
Csene. They settled on the black bar jutting out of the flood area             
where Csekonics' stud farm (Ménes) later stood. From there came the             
first name, <i>Crna-Greda [Black Bar]</i>. Later the settlement was             
moved to where the Serbian church stands today. Since the earth was             
black they named the place Crnja (Zerne). In the 17th century, a             
settlement there called Olesch or Olasch was destroyed by the Turks. In             
1775, the Serbian church was built on the site.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1790, Josef von Csekonics settled our ancestors             
just west of the Serbian village. Even before the settlement a few             
German families were there. In the beginning, there were only 55             
houses. All of the first settlers came from the neighboring village of             
Hatzfeld. From the origin of the settlers, we derived the Hatzfeld             
street names (Trierer-, Mainzer-, Luxemburger-, Lothringer-Gasse). New             
settlers constantly streamed out of Hatzfeld, Heufeld, Mastort, St.             
Hubert, Soltur, and Charlevill. In 1800, there were already 218 houses

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The             
village of Serbisch-Zerne had a 4,500 Kat. joch

There were 140 farmers in Deutsch-Zerne. Each one             
leased 25 joch of farmland from the manor lords: a 17 joch farm field,             
a 7 joch meadow, and a 1 joch clover garden. After the introduction of             
crop rotation, the order of plantings in the individual fields of the             
manor lords was prescribed and had to be strictly observed. The lease             
contained the following requirements: in addition to the exact amount             
no longer being determined, every farmer was obliged to mow, dry and             
gather into haystacks a 2 joch field of vetch, to reap and set on their             
backs a 4 joch field of wheat, to import 300 back loads of wheat, and,             
in the fall, everyone had to till a 4 joch field and </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">plant root <br>

The farmer was </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">allowed             
to sell his lease but only to someone acceptable to the lord of the             
manor. He could bequeath it to only one of his children.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the families became very rich in children,             
they were very short of land for building; therefore, they extended the             
main street to the south. Until then, it extended only to the houses of             
Christoph Grün and Johann Bischof. For this reason, the southern part             
of the main street is named “<i>Neue-Gasse</i>"<i> [New Street]</i>. In             
1850, they began to extend the double street to the Serbisch-Zerne             
district in the south where there previously had been wine gardens and             
a Serbian cemetery. This Serbisch-Zerne area inhabited by Germans was             
named after a former higher court judge, Ferenczyutca (in the common             
tongue <i>Ferenc-utca</i>). This accounts for the large German             
population in Serbisch-Zerne. The German school building in             
Serbisch-Zerne was built upon the former churchyard land. Mostly poorer             
people who earned their livelihood as day laborers, servants at the             
manor, or as groups at harvest or threshing lived there. Each fellow             
was awarded a 1 joch corn field and a 1/4 joch field of potatoes. Many             
of these groups were familiar. The group leaders were Johann Tabar             
(Tschak), Michael Grün, Michael Heschel, and Josef Killberger. Another             
part of the population of our sister communities, who were able to             
purchase </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">horses,             
carriages and farming tools, worked on the manor field for an agreed
amount of the harvest (contractor). They maintained a parcel of clover
field. There a considerable number of artisans also found work and a
good livelihood.<br>

In the Romanian area 5 kilometers from the frontier lies the beautiful
German municipality of Hatzfeld from which came the largest proportion
of our pioneer ancestors. In the north were our neighboring communities
of Heufeld, Mastort and Ruskodorf, somewhat further northwest, the
so-called French villages of St. Hubert, Soltur, and Charlevill. In the
south were the neighboring communities of Hungarian-Zerne (Nova Crnja)
and Vojvoda Stepo, in the northeast, Klarija, in the southeast, Hetin.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The terrain of our villages was flat; they lay on a             
fruitful plain where there were neither mountains nor rivers nor             
streams. The fruitful terrain provided abundant crop yields.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The climate of our homeland was moderate in its             
continental character, summer being hot and dry with occasional             
thunderstorms and hail that caused some damage to the crops. The winter             
was not too cold and did not last too long. The late autumn and spring             
brought most precipitation. Whenever the ground-water level was high,             
the fields would flood and considerable damage occurred.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our two municipalities actually formed a large             
settlement whose eastern area populated by Serbians and southwestern             
area populated by Germans was known as Serbisch-Zerne. However, the             
western area formed the community of Deutsch-Zerne. Consequently, some             
houses in Serbisch-Zerne that were inhabited by Serbians belonged to             
Deutsch-Zerne, and some isolated German houses in Deutsch-Zerne             
actually belonged to Serbisch-Zerne. This strange situation had             
occurred due to the land ownership within each settlement.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Relationships between both population groups were             
good, proper, and benevolent until the end of World War I. The change             
in political circumstances, deliberate arousal of national feelings and             
passions, partitioning of the Csekonics holdings among Serbian             
volunteers (Dobrovoljci) and colonists, development of two large             
Serbian colonies on Deutsch-Zerne property, and the blatant attempt of             
the administration to strengthen the Slavish element — without             
consideration for the interests and limited alternatives of the             
long-time German residents — led to a deterioration of good <br>

With the</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> numerical
rearrangement of population areas in Deutsch-Zerne whereby the Serbians
achieved majority, there arose such violent altercations over the
community political property that the community seat was relocated to
the colony of Vojvoda Stepo and the name of the village became Vojvoda
Stepo. Only with extreme difficulty did Deutsch-Zerne become autonomous
again.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the course of time, passions cooled down again             
and relations with one another improved so that, especially during the             
hard times of World War II, order was generally maintained and everyone             
tried to provide protection to each other.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our communities had straight lanes running parallel             
that were joined by cross lanes. They were immaculate, especially the             
areas inhabited by Germans. A row of trees, mainly acacias, was planted             
along both sides of the pavement, and a lovely fragrance emanated             
during the blooming season. Footpaths were paved all the way through             
with firebricks so that one could also walk easily in bad weather. The             
houses were without floors, the roofs covered with tiles. In earlier             
times, the walls were made of rammed earth; later they were constructed             
with kiln bricks up to the base height and much later completely with             
kiln bricks. The area between the walls was filled with clay. The main             
gable faced the street. The house extended to a courtyard and, on the             
courtyard side, a wide gangway that in many cases was threaded with             
wine grapes or other vines, was usually slab-built. The farmer’s house             
consisted of the following rooms: toward the street was the parlor. It             
was only used occasionally and was the showroom of the house. The             
kitchen was located inside where a door led to the courtyard. Next was             
a small room that served as living room and lounge. Here most of the             
life of the family was spent. Then came the pantry, the storage house             
of supplies, which often was used as a second kitchen. The rooms             
usually had wooden floors. Last of all were the stalls for the cattle.             
In the attic, grain was stored; in the cellar, potatoes, wine, etc.             
That is the general picture of a farmer’s house. Well-to-do people, who             
wanted to have more living space, extended the house along the street,             
so there developed the <i>Winkelhaus [crooked or angled house]</i>.</font></p>

In the courtyard space parallel to the main building, there was an             
auxiliary building. The summer kitchen was often located here followed             
by a wagon and supply shed. In the farmhouse were also supplies of             
straw, hay, chaff, cornhusks, pig stalls, and the corn storage “<i>kotarka</i>”.             
The property was surrounded with a fence made of wire, boards, or             
slats. On the street side was a brick wall and rarely locked wooden             
gate. The houses and rooms were beautifully plastered inside and             
outside. The living rooms and hallway were painted. Order and             
cleanliness dominated overall, on the streets, in the house and the             
courtyard, so that everything gave a pleasing impression.</font></p>

A short time after the settlement of our community we had to address             
some problems so that proper order would reign in our village. Every             
settler had obligations to assume, the fulfillment of which had to be             
monitored for the common good. That was the task of the court of law.             
In the fore was the supreme judge, and there were also the following             
members: the lower court judge, several jury members, and an orphanage             
superintendent. To them was entrusted the administration of the             
community. The supreme judge controlled unlimited power of the             
establishment and therefore, everyone had great respect for him.             
Elections were as follows: the lord of the manor had the right to             
recommend three capable citizens for these positions and the vote took             
place by acclamation. Whoever had the most votes was elected. In the             
same way, the remaining members of the town council and the aldermen             
were elected.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The members of the town council helped the judge in             
the execution of his office. The treasurer managed the finances. The             
orphanage superintendent watched over the fate of orphans and their             
assets. The lower court judge (a civil servant) had various public             
services to provide. He also kept order and proclaimed orders of the             
town council with drumbeats and loud cries.</font></p>

The town council and the aldermen held their meetings in the community             
house. Community officials performed the written work. At the head             
stood the notary public. His deputy was the vice-notary public.<br>             
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first decades after the settlement of Zerne,             
as the laws and police duties were still not exactly defined, the town             
judge had a lot of power and authority. If someone should get into             
debt, commit a misdemeanor, play some pranks, or commit petty theft,             
the judge had the right to impose heavy penalties. The culprit was             
arrested or whipped as punishment. At the whipping, he had to lie on a             
bench in the presence of curious onlookers and receive from the judge             
the number of strikes that had been assigned to him with a hazel stick.             
After the refinement of the laws and police duties, the town judge was             
allowed to declare only very small administrative penalties. The             
militia, which kept the peace at night and protected the goods and             
chattels of inhabitants, was no longer necessary; the constabulary             
undertook these duties.<br>             
      <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our community belonged to the district seat of             
Hatzfeld (Zsombolya). The district judge and Finance Office were also             
there. In 1924 Hatzfeld became part of Romania in a boundary treaty             
between Yugoslavia and Romania, and the communities of Modosch (Jaša             
Tomić) and Pardan (Ninčićevo) were annexed to Yugoslavia. From then on             
our district seat was Jaša Tomić and the district court and finance             
office were in Grossbetschkerek.</font></p>

The territory of our homeland community was owned by the Csekonics             
family. Since the Banat had been freed from the Turks, it was under the             
administration of the Vienna exchequer who was anxious to market             
Banater goods to deserving nobles for, due to the many wars that             
Austria had to fight, the treasury was empty and had to be filled up.             
For this reason, the territory came into the possession of the             
Csekonics family. They descended from Croatian nobility and provided             
the imperial army many courageous commissioned officers. One of them,             
of course, was Josef von Csekonics, the Austrian general. As soon as             
the Csekonics family took possession of the territory, they considered             
it their foremost task to settle and reclaim the land. In the course of             
time, fruitful farmland would spring from this wilderness and             
swampland. As their domicile they chose Hatzfeld, in the middle of             
which they built a beautiful castle which was surrounded by a wonderful             
park. Later there arose at the southern outskirts of the community a             
larger castle built in the English style with a beautiful well-kept             
park and a forest, which became cherished by the Hatzfeld people as a             
place for outings. A beautiful parkway led from Hatzfeld to this castle             
(Csitó). Just next to Csitó was the burial vault of the count’s family             
where family members found their final resting-place. Besides these two             
castles, the count’s family owned several palaces in the capital city             
of Budapest, Hungary, and a property in Enying with a 7,000 joch field             
in the vicinity of Budapest. Their Banat territory was 33,000 joch.             
Three communities were settled there: Deutsch-Zerne, Hungarian-Zerne,             
and Csösztelek (Tschestelek).</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourteen thousand joch of the count’s territory             
belonged to Deutsch-Zerne. For easier management tenant farms were             
built. Officers, hired workers, craftsmen, and other attendants lived             
there, and they administered and worked the estate. Hundreds of             
villagers also found work and income there. The administrative center             
of the property was in Hatzfeld. Included in Deutsch-Zerne were the             
following tenant farms: Julia-major, Sziget-major, Endre-major,             
Szöllös-major, Konstancia-major, Klein- Konstancia-major,             
Klein-Rokus-major, Leona-major, Sándor-major, Klein-Julia-major,             
Margitháza, and Fácányos.</font></p>

Besides farming there were some centers of emphasis for other branches             
of trade. Klein-Julia-major and Szöllös-major had large dairies;             
Klein-Konstancia-major and Sziget-major were centers for pig breeding.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There were schools in Julia-major and             
Konstancia-major for children of the employees. There was also a church             
in Konstancia-major where the chaplain from Deutsch-Zerne held services             
every Sunday. A doctor was responsible for the medical care of the             
employees. The pastor and doctor received a yearly stipend. A wagon and             
driver were also placed at the doctor's disposal free of charge. In             
Julia-major, there was a steam mill, large warehouses, electric             
lighting, and large workshops for the maintenance and repair of the             
farming machines. Also near Julia-major was the manorial stud farm             
(Ménes), the center of horse breeding for the property.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The individual tenant farms were linked together by             
wide streets, on both sides of which acacia trees were planted. Even an             
industrial railroad connected the larger farms. At Julia-major they had             
a connection to the Betschkerek-Hatzfeld narrow gauge railway. The             
nobility had contributed a large sum toward its construction. Likewise,             
they contributed much to the commercial development of all the villages             
along the rail line.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A great deal of attention was also given to the             
wilderness preserve. The area had many small woodlands. The largest was             
a few hundred joch so-named <i>Jägerwald</i> (Hunter’s Woods), where             
deer and pheasant were bred. There was also an office for the ranger.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The whole territory was threaded with trenches that             
led to the Bega River. They served as drainage of the earth and ground             
water and averted the accumulation of water on the farmlands.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through their investment and cultivation, the             
territories of the manor became a model economy that was often             
inspected by foreign visitors.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>

The life of our ancestors in the time of the             
settlement was extremely difficult. In an unfamiliar climate, with             
primitive tools and equipment, in a swampy region full of noxious             
fumes, they worked the earth with its lush undergrowth and weeds. Wild,             
dangerous beasts threatened their health and life. Parasites destroyed             
the crops while flooding of the fields and hailstorms also contributed.             
One can truly visualize how difficult the work was if one wanted to             
make a furrow in bristly, overgrown earth with a wooden plow that has             
weak traction. How long would one have to work a field until even 1             
joch is plowed! So, of course, all family members capable of working             
had to help in the field. In the beginning, they could not even think             
of plowing the grounds every year. The sowings took place mostly in the             
clod-filled soil where the seed grew with difficulty. When the time             
came for the maize to be harvested, they performed this chore with a             
hoe, for the chopping plow was still unknown at that time. And when the             
harvest time came, again all work-hardy members had to work the fields.             
Thunderstorms and hailstorms threatened to blast the earth, and so             
haste was necessary. The lord of the manor could demand at any time             
that the prescribed manual labor be performed on his property; then             
everyone had to stop and leave their work in order to meet their             
obligations to the manor lord. When one realizes that they cut their             
crop with a sickle —</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">             
in the beginning the scythe was still unknown —</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> then one can conjecture how long
the reaping lasted. When the crops at the manor and and at home had
been brought in, then the toilsome labor of treading began. Treading on
the threshing floor with horses, if there was no rain, often lasted
from 3 in the morning until 9 o'clock at night. </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">As long as the wind blew, the

these chores were done, then began the work of corn cracking, cutting             
and spreading mulch. Autumn sowing often lasted until Christmas if the             
weather was bad. The community meadows were divided and the same             
variety of grain was grown in each meadow year after year because the             
benefits of crop rotation were still unknown. The fallow meadow was             
used as a cattle feedlot. The young cattle stayed there day and night             
from spring until fall; after the reaping, they dug it all up like the             
stubble meadows. To stop thieves, meadow guards were elected who             
received a fair amount of fallow meadow in kind. The cowshed manure was             
at first not brought out onto the fields because there was no time for             
that. They took it to the ground pit and unloaded it there.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under these conditions, it was really a huge effort             
for our forefathers to endure in their new homeland. Although many             
sacrificed and many failed, their iron will, diligence, perseverance,             
and firm confidence in a better future always inspired them with new             
courage. In time they could acquire better tools, equipment and             
machinery to lighten their load, facilitate better management, and make             
life easier.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us review the most important events:<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 1816 to 1836 there were frequent crop failures             
caused by floods, hailstorms, rust, locusts, caterpillars and beetles.             
There was no harvest at all in 1836. In the years 1831, 1836, and 1849             
cholera raged and claimed many fatalities. In 1848 the Hungarian             
Revolution erupted and ended in 1849. It brought no damage or victims             
to the community. The 1850s were rather good; except for small cattle             
plagues, they were good years. The years 1860 and 1861-1862 were very             
dry and the wells dried up. In 1863 there was a crop failure. There was             
neither bread nor fodder. In 1866 the crops froze in the field, and in             
1868-1869 there was much hail damage. In 1870, the fields were so             
flooded that in 1871, 1872 and 1863 they were swampland. The years             
1874-1882 became known as the Rust Years, during which the people </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">suffered much </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">privation. In 1882, this

the people to relieve their             
destitution. On September 23, 1886, there was a fire in the house of

growing stronger and they seized the opportunity to enlarge their             
properties. The first opportunity was in the Serbisch-Zerne meadow. Up             
to 32 joch fields were purchased here. In 1905, the Deutsch-Zerne             
farmers received those fields as a replacement, but only 17 joch, not             
25. The clover garden was eliminated (140 joch) and the meadows, still             
7 joch, remained under lease until 1911; until then the lease was paid             
and slave labor was rendered. For 17 joch, the purchase price was             
13,000 crowns, and this amount was amortized for 65 years. The manor             
lord built the Sándor-major farmhouse on the former meadows.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It should also be mentioned that the Deutsch-Zerne             
grazing pasture (140 joch) that spread out to the west of the community             
was sold in 1908 to poor people (1-2 joch), leaving merely 30 joch for             
community use as a cattle and soil pit.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1906 the property of the Ernö von Kiss family was             
parceled out – he was one of the Honvéd generals executed October 6,             
1849 in Arad – as was the property of the Duke of Parma, the family of             
the later Austrian Empress Zita, in 1911. So it was necessary for the             
farmers to take every opportunity to expand their property, of which             
they freely availed themselves. The latter property belonged to the             
communities of Mastort and Toba. At that time, farmers purchased a             
1,200 joch field. This newly acquired property was located some             
distance away from their existing property, which would have made             
cultivation difficult. For this reason, the property owners constructed             
farm inns (<i>Puszta, Sallasch, Hodaja</i>) with the requisite servant             
quarters, stables, working quarters, and everything else that was             
necessary for husbandry. They even provided lodging for the summer stay             
of the farm owners.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1944, Zerne inhabitants owned farm inns in the             
following communities: Ittebe, Mastort, Toba, Topola, Vojvoda-Stepo,             
Klarija, and Deutsch-Zerne.</font></p>

      <p align="justify">&nbsp;<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The heavy and             
difficult work our ancestors had to perform during the time of             
settlement and the primitive tools with which they accomplished it             
demonstrated to us their very early ingenuity. However, development and             
progress did not stand still. In time, more practical tools,             
implements, and machines became available for their use. Around the             
year 1865, the iron plow displaced the wooden plow. Several years later             
there were even sharper plows. This not only made their work easier,             
but it also enabled them to work the fields more efficiently, plow in             
the manure, and attain better crop yields. Since they previously cut             
the grain with scythe and sickle, which took a lot of time and hard             
work, the reaper and sheaf binder soon found application. The former             
began to be used in 1905. The crops were no longer trodden laboriously             
with horses. By 1880 there were two steam-run threshing machines, owned             
by Johann Tabar (Ferenc-utca) and Nikolaus Frauenhoffer (House Number             
197). The threshing was initially done on the common pastures because             
they feared fire since many houses had a reed roof. After the turn of             
the century, they were also allowed to thresh on their own farmland.             
Also at this time they used straw elevators. In 1900, the first             
self-propelled threshing machine was also put into operation. The             
owners were the locksmiths Kremm and Frauenhoffer.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before World War II there were 14 threshing machines             
that also threshed outwards. At first, the grinding of corn took place             
in horse-powered mills. The first one was built by the married couple,             
Franz Franz and Annamaria, née Burghardt. Even a windmill stood on the             
Serbisch-Zerne property. Its owner was Josef Krettler, and later Anton             
Krettler. Locksmith Johann Tabar built the first steam mill. It was             
shut down at the turn of the century because the owner moved away. Its             
site was at the southern end of Ferenc-utca (Ott Franz).</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great significance was attached to corn cultivation.             
Right after settlement in the Banat it was seeded with a hoe since they             
did not have enough time to work it around and had no special tools to             
do this. Since they had iron plows then, the field was worked             
beforehand and the corn </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">was </font></p>

in furrows so that
the plants always stood in rows. Soon the light plow was also used.
This lightened their workload immensely and saved them much time. The
corn was hacked 2-3 times and finally accumulated. During the year, the
corn crops involved little work. When it was ripe, it was broken and
placed for drying in the corn sheds (<i>Hambar, Kotarko</i>). It had to
be gathered for use as animal feed. While this was done at first by
hand, the chore was </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">later
      </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">accomplished
with a manually operated corn-gatherer, and finally with a motor-run
corn-gatherer. Oats, barley, rye, were planted only to a small degree,
vegetables and potatoes only for home use. Clover, alfalfa, millet, and
root vegetables served as cattle feed. Rapeseed was less often
produced, </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">also </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">hemp but not very often, to the

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wine growing found its way into our village at a             
very early stage. Even during the settlement, the settlers were             
provided with wine garden parcels. They were planted with European             
grapes that they brought in themselves. Toward the end of the 19th             
century, the wine pest appeared, and bit by bit it demolished all the             
wine gardens. For this reason, they began to plant refined grapes with             
American support. Wine growing soon came to be produced to cover their             
individual needs.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time of settlement, the settlers had been             
required to raise silkworms and, for that reason, to plant mulberry             
trees. It was thought that the settlers could improve their income with             
this source of revenue. It never developed into anything significant.             
The fruits were used for making Schnapps.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;To make their work easier to handle, in the             
course of time more and more practical implements and machines were             
brought into use, besides those previously mentioned. These were:             
sowers, wind-operated grain separators</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">, wheat-seed sorters, grass
mowers, two- and three-share plows, harrows, steamrollers, hay

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stockbreeding was of no less significance from the             
farmer’s viewpoint. The half-caste horse belonging to the <i>Nonius</i>             
breed served as a draft animal. It was a tenacious horse with swift             
gait. Cattle breeding was also of great importance. Dairy cows served

cities. Another good source of income for our people was pig breeding.
The most popular pig breed was the native <i>Mangolica</i>. They
served not only as required fat and meat needs of the family but also
brought substantial sales revenue. In the last period before World War
I, English Berkshire and Yorkshire pigs became widespread in our
community.</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Earlier there was much interest in sheep farming. The sheep — winter             
months excluded — were given over to shepherds for care. During the             
year they supplied milk and a certain amount of cheese and gave up             
their wool, and in late autumn the sheep and lambs returned home. For             
this reason, sheep were of great importance because our ancestors made             
various articles of clothing out of the wool during the winter months.             
Later, because there were no more pasture areas left, sheep farming was             
completely given up.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Fowl covered their demand for eggs; their flesh found good use in the             
kitchen, their quills found use as bed feathers. The rest of the fowl             
brought welcome sales revenue.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Small business also demonstrated a steady improvement. They were never             
lacking in the necessary new blood. After an apprentice completed his             
years of indenture, he took to wandering. His traveling years led him             
into neighboring cities, and often all the way to Budapest or Vienna.             
This gave him the opportunity to strengthen his vocation and expand his             
mental horizons. Many of them remained away permanently, established             
their own foreign business, became self-sufficient, and started a             
family. Those who returned to their homeland many years later, after             
fulfilling their military obligation, established their own business             
there. The tradesmen were united together in a guild. Industrious             
traders provided for the needs of the people with products to offer.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
The brick works were founded in 1880. The founders were the locksmith             
Nikolaus Frauenhoffer, the razor craftsman Kern, the merchants Anton             
Hönig and Josef Kiefer. They were located in Serbisch-Zerne and gave

So much was done for them, even for their health. While at first they             
took drinking water from their house wells, later deep-seated wells             
were built for the community; these were followed by artesian wells.             
The number of artesian wells before World War I was 6. In case of             
sickness, there was a doctor at their disposal. The first doctor was             
Dr. Muraközy Dezsö. He also attended the sick in the leasehold farms of             
the manor and received from them payment in kind. The nurses of the             
convent gave valuable service in the care and nurturing of the sick. In             
our fond memory was Sister Sarolta of the Sisters of the Cross, who             
left our area in 1922. Also in the health service were the midwives:             
Katharina Spitz, Maria Engel, Emilie Koch.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the last century before World War I, the upgrade             
of transportation contributed in a special way to the welfare of the             
community. In 1887, they built the Hatzfeld-Betschkerek highway, and on             
October 19, 1898 the narrow gauge railway was brought into operation.             
In like manner, it connected Hatzfeld to Betschkerek and passed through             
our area.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the thrifty and credit-wise they established a             
credit cooperative in 1900; it was a member of the country’s credit             
cooperative in Budapest. Its first accountant was Franz Zahradnyik, a             
schoolteacher, later Josef Kreps; the cashier was Franz Kremer, a             
schoolteacher. After the crash, the cooperative ceased business.             
Earlier they had built a warehouse at the train station. It served the             
members and retail market as storage for crops. The private banking             
business of merchant Nikolaus Schleimer also should be mentioned.</font></p>

ultimatum from the Serbians resulted in the declaration of war by
Austria-Hungary against the Serbians on July 28, 1914. The war lasted 4
years, from 1914 until 1918. With few exceptions, all countries of
Europe and a considerable number of countries outside of Europe were
involved. Naturally, this war had its own impact on the relations in
our homeland and our sister communities. On July 26 followed the area
mobilization, and all conscripts up to 40 years of age had to report.
Due to the rapid enlistment of many nations in the war, nationwide
mobilization was ordered at once, and a grueling battle flared up on
all fronts. In the first year of the war, horses and vehicles were
requisitioned. Soon a relief mobile for the wounded was set up in many
communities, in 1916 also by ours. On April 30 of the same year, the
clock was advanced by 1 hour to save electricity and lighting. In
August 1916, the Romanians entered the war on the opposing side, and
the people of Siebenburg <i>[Kronstadt]</i> fled in the face of
invading Romanian troops. Siebenburg Saxons soon marched; however, they
trekked home shortly after their homeland was purged of foes. The
longer the war lasted, the more difficulties people had to bear. Church
bells were melted down for the manufacture of war materials; the people
were called upon to subscribe for war bonds. To prevent the steady rise
of the cost of food, they created price ceilings and issued food ration
cards. In most instances, food was confiscated so that they could feed
the armies and the city people. Only 10-18 kilograms of wheat was
allowed each person per month, and 50% corn meal had to be mixed into
bread flour. Wheat could only be ground in the mill with a meal pass.
Naturally they tried to get around these orders; for that reason, many
bread grains were hidden and ground by moonlight. Since the men of 18
to 52 years were serving in the campaign, the old men, women and
children at home had to perform superhuman feats. To relieve them,
Russian prisoners of war were assigned to them as workers. Due to fear
of the depreciation of money, gold and silver coins disappeared; even
nickel and copper coins were hoarded, which led to a change shortage.
Hardly anything could be bought at the ceiling price. The black market </font><br>

not be generally available. It finally happened that they devolved to
barter. The result was that trains were crammed with villagers going to
the cities and people with something to barter traveled in the opposite
direction. The city inhabitants needed mostly food, while the country
inhabitants were generally in need of textiles, basic commodities,
especially petroleum. It came to the point that in many houses they
were forced to use tallow lights for illumination.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great privation in the cities, which rose to a

recuperation.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after tremendous war fatigue and signs of             
decay emerged in the last years of war, the war was ended in November             
1918 with the defeat of Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and Turkey.             
The Serbian army possessed the whole of the Banat. In 1919, the             
Austro-Hungarian crown was discounted by 20%. In the same year, the             
Serbian army evacuated the eastern Banat, which was occupied by             
Romania. The line of demarcation ran past the communities of Grabatz,             
Gertianosch, Grosskomlosch. Ostern and Hatzfeld remained Serbian.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; According to the Treaty of Trianon of June 4, 1920,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That same year followed the currency exchange. Four             
crowns were exchanged for one dinar.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>

The end of World War I brought enormous changes in             
all respects. After the truce in November 1918, the first Serbian             
occupation troops appeared and took possession of our sister             
communities. Even before their entry, there were a few transgressions             
by the Serbian section of the population. They robbed and plundered the             
leasehold farms of Count Csekonics. But that lasted only a very short             
time, and soon peace and order reigned. In 1920, the Peace Treaty of             
Trianon awarded the western part of the Banat to the newly founded             
nation, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenians, to which both of             
our sister communities belonged. Tremendous changes were heralded and             
undertaken. First, the property of Count Csekonics was confiscated; it             
was later distributed to Serbian war volunteers and colonists and the             
poorer ranks of the local Serbian population. For Count Csekonics there             
remained only 500 joch in Julia-major, the stud farm, 82 joch with the             
attached house, and Konstancia-major with the Hunter’s Forest. The             
other leasehold farms were cleared away, sold as building materials,             
and used in other ways. In Leona-major, they founded a new settlement             
named Vojvoda-Stepo with 720 home sites. The settlers, war volunteers,             
came from Bosnia, Herzegowina, and Lika. Every family received an 8¾             
joch field. The poor local Serbian population, who had no house and             
field, were settled at Julia-major. The settlement was called             
Vojvoda-Bojović. Those who settled here received 3 joch per married             
couple, 1/2 joch for every child under 12, and 1 joch for youths from             
12 to 18 years. Both settlements belonged to the community of             
Deutsch-Zerne (Nemačka-Crnja). They experienced a swift recovery due to             
massive support of the state. The number of inhabitants soon formed the             
majority in the community. At the community election in 1934, the             
Serbians obtained the majority on the community council; Jovo Milić of             
Vojvoda-Stepo was elected town judge. On February 2, 1935, they moved             
the seat of the community to the colony of Vojvoda Stepo, 7 km. away –             
on the grounds of a community counsel decision made by the             
administration within.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now arose the grotesque situation that Germans were             
made to pay taxes while Serbians – who for the most part were free of             
taxes and assessments – administered the community. In 1936, after a             
long, difficult struggle our community was separated from the community

independent. Implementation had to wait until March 1937. In this             
reorganization, the community received 3,000 joch of land according to             
the land register. Vojvoda Bojović, with the regions of Klein-Julia,             
Szöllös-major, and the German wine gardens, was attached to             
Serbisch-Zerne. The territory of Sziget-major and Klein-Sziget fell to             
the community of Klarija because Serbians from Klarija owned the fields.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fortune and development of the community was             
tumultuous after World War I, but the political change had a disastrous             
effect on the fate of Germans in our sister communities. The livelihood             
of many men was abolished or at least complicated. People who had             
earned their living at the manor estate now had nothing. The politics             
of the state was arranged thereafter solely to improve the position of             
the Serbian element, to make things easier for them, and so to             
strengthen them. For the national minorities, including Germans, their             
livelihood was taken away after the indifferent distribution of estate             
property in the name of agrarian reform. They deliberately made them             
beggars and, in many cases, drove them to emigration, which brought             
about great bitterness. In large numbers, they left the homeland where             
they were treated like step-children and sought the advantages of life             
in North and South America, the United States, Canada and Argentina. Of             
course, the estate farmer had the advantage that he could easily pay             
back his debts because of the depreciation of currency. It soon             
happened, though, that he came into great difficulty because of a             
worldwide economic crisis, the fall of crop prices, a property levy,             
and the war profit tax, which was collected with rigorous cruelty. They             
were forced to break new ground and to carve out a better means of             
existence for themselves. The ever-increasing shortage of labor forced             
them to acquire more and better tools and machines with which an             
intensive cultivation of the earth would be possible and, thereby,             
larger yields could be achieved. They applied these yields — since the             
prices were very low — in their own agricultural enterprise; in stock             
farming; fat stock, especially fat pigs, brought them good revenue.             
While before World War I they generally bred native <i>Mangolica</i>             
pigs, which was an </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">excellent

breeds, like Yorkshire and Berkshire, and later, to the refined German
country pig. These suited their taste and the desire of the times for
better marketing opportunities. Corporate organizations cared for the
breed and exploited the agricultural and animal products. The
cooperatives also provided for the thrifty and credit-wise. In our home
location were the following cooperatives:</font></p>
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
      <b>Credit Cooperative.</b> Founded 1900. Re-established 1923. At             
the re-opening of the agency, Anton Stiebel, Sr. especially exerted             
himself. He was also the first chairman of the administrative board.             
After his death, Gustav Schmidt took his place. Employees were Josef             
Kreps as bookkeeper, and Hans Tabar, the schoolteacher, as cashier. The             
depository trustee was Johann Stuprich, afterwards Josef Mayer.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In 1928, the German cooperative “<i>Agraria</i>” was founded with the             
help of <i>Bauernhilfe</i> <i>[</i></font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i>Farmer's Help]</i> </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">and other sister cooperatives.
Presiding over Agraria were Kaspar Schweininger, bookkeeper, and

Anton Kampf.</font></p>

There were good times for industry and commerce at the end of World War             
I. Brisk building activity, colonization of the former property of             
Count Csekonics, immigration of numerous colonists all increased the             
need for various goods and furniture. The annexation of Hatzfeld to             
Romania in 1924 also benefited this development. In spite of the             
depression, an upward movement was noticeable to meet larger demands             
and to keep pace with the times.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Besides biweekly markets, 4 yearly markets also took place.</font></p>             
      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In 1928, the Trade Corporation was founded for the people of Deutsch-             
and Serbisch-Zerne, and, to claim secondary growth in trade and             
industry, a new school for apprentices emerged. Acting as teachers             
were: Pavle Zadera, Hans Tabar, Mirko Mitrović, and Michael Kremer. In             
1941, it was shut down.</font></p>

further progress between the two World Wars. A new steam mill arose             
near the train station. The builders were Nikolaus Frauenhoffer and             
Josef Stiebel. Later it was owned by the brothers Franz and Josef             
Kremer, except that soon after it was destroyed by fire.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1928, electrical lighting was introduced. The             
family of Nicka assumed ownership of the operation.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1932, the Lenhardt <i>Kunstmühle [grist mill]</i>

but they also exported into the territory of Yugoslavia and abroad. The             
owners were Martin and Magdalena Lenhardt, née Hemmert.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health service progress was also noticeable. After

him, Dr. Markus Steiner and later Dr. Nikolaus Gerhard took up

When our ancestors left their homeland and came to the Banat as             
settlers, they were deeply religious. They not only performed their             
daily table prayers, but before the great celebrations, such as Advent             
and Lent, they fervently prayed the rosary with family or at meetings.             
Found in every house were votive candles, a crucifix, and holy pictures             
to decorate the walls of the rooms. The prayer books bound with leather             
with their yellowed pages showed that they were used frequently. Every             
Sunday and Holy Day they attended church with the exception of one             
family member, the one who cooked. Therefore, it was their most fervent             
desire to have their own church. In the beginning, our settlement             
belonged to the mother community of Hatzfeld. They attended church             
there and registration of the parish was done there. Later a chapel             
might have been built there in which services could be held, but Josef             
von Csekonics had already built our own parish church in 1808. Clay             
bricks served as building materials. The roof was covered with             
shingles. The lord of the manor provided the building materials and the             
artisans. The people provided the labor. The community received 4 joch             
for the churchyard on the western outskirts. On September 1, 1808,&nbsp;</font></p>

by Bishop Ladislaus             
Köszeghy von Remete. Its benefactors were the lords of the manor at             
that time. They were Josef von Csekonics, Count Johann von Csekonics,             
and the last one, Count Andreas von Csekonics. The rights and             
responsibilities of the benefactor were specifically documented. The             
priest received yearly payment in kind from the benefactor, and the             
benefactor assumed upkeep of the church. The priest also received             
smaller payments from the community, and the community paid the             
organist and sacristan. After World War I, the newly founded church             
community undertook the responsibilities of the political community.             
The question of the pastor’s stipend and the upkeep of the church             
remained outstanding for years, for after World War I the ownership of             
the property of the manor lord was, of course, divided between Serbian             
war volunteers and colonists. Because of this, they were unable to             
satisfy their patronage obligations. After extensive negotiations, the             
agrarian authorities agreed to relinquish a 50 joch field in the             
vicinity of the brick kiln for the organist in compensation for the             
loss of income from the manor lord.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1811, the stone cross and statues in front of the             
church were built at the expense of the people. In 1847, the church was             
robbed and considerable damage was done.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The inside of the church was beautiful, particularly             
the magnificent main altar and Marian altar. Over the course of the             
years, the inside of the church became even more exquisite through new             
spending by the faithful; the statues built by the Lichtfuss family and             
Nikolaus Tines also contributed considerably.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At infrequent intervals, missions, sponsored more             
recently by the Redemptorist fathers, took place for the strengthening             
and deepening of the faith. The mission cross at the church entrance             
commemorates the mission held in 1908. Missions also took place in the             
20th and 30th anniversary years. On prayer days, they led processions             
to the field crosses. One stood in the vicinity of the brick kiln,             
south of the village, a second on the west side, and the third on the             
north side. The latter was made of marble and was built by the married             
couple, Franz and Pauline Kremer.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although a certain indifference to religion,             
awakened and nourished by outside influences, has become noticeable in             
the decades after World War I, there was still a large flock of

teachers, the singers; the priest followed them under a canopy with the             
Holy of Holies, the Marian maids, and the community and corporate             
leaders. The fireworks were always excellent. Finally, during Holy             
Week, an honor guard was formed and pretended to be guarding the tomb.             
Hundreds of believers participated in the processions, and it was             
impressive when the closing song in the church resounded:<br>

Immediately after the settlement, a school was opened for the children.             
The school building was first constructed in 1808. Where the children             
were instructed up until this point of time is not ascertainable. They             
placed much value on the education of their children, but especially             
upon their religious education. Our school had a denominational

by order of the Education Administration and control of the school

He must be able to read,             
write, and do arithmetic. In addition to his teaching duties, he had to             
provide the customary service of the sacristan and ring the bells. His             
pay was marginal. In the early days, they used the schoolmaster like an             
adopted non-commissioned officer or a better-educated tradesman.             
Consequently, educational achievements were very moderate, yes low. At             
the time of the settlement, school regulations from the year 1774 were             
in force. After this there were:</font></p>

The 6 to 8 year old children attended summer school. It began after             
Easter and lasted until Michaelmas <i>[September 29th]</i>. During             
harvest time, there were 4 weeks of recess. There was no school in             
winter because the paths were too bad for the smaller children.             
Besides, most of them could not attend school because of their poor             
clothing.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The children from 9 through 12 years attended winter             
school from December 1 until Easter. In the summer months, they were             
available to assist their parents.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For the older children there was refresher             
school.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The school ordinances, school laws respectively,             
changed repeatedly in the course of time. The educational results             
increasingly improved, especially after the introduction of compulsory             
education and better training for the teacher. The first rudiments for             
the betterment of teacher education occurred in 1774 in Temeschburg             
where they instructed the teacher – now no longer a schoolmaster – in a             
modern manner. In 1844, this school was closed, but after the events of             
the Revolution in 1852, they established the Werschetzer Catholic             
College of Education from which many eminent personalities emerged for

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The language of instruction until the 90th year <span style="font-style: italic;">[1890]</span> was German; from             
then until 1918, it was Hungarian; and after             
1918, the German language gradually lost out to Serbian. In 1941, the             
German school system was placed under the “School Foundation of Germans             
in the Banat” and the German language of instruction was again adopted.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As was already mentioned, the first school building             
was constructed in 1808. Later, due to the large number of children, a             
nearby house was acquired for the girls’ school. After this building             
became old and decrepit in 1911, Count Csekonics had it demolished and             
a totally new school building constructed. Due to a smaller number of             
students in 1928, this building was sold to Schoolmaster Hans Tabar.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1918, it was ordered by the school administration             
that only a schoolmaster could be headmaster (school director), and so             
the parish priest, who until then also held the headmaster’s position,             
was replaced by a schoolmaster. When in the sister community of             
Serbisch-Zerne the number of Germans in the settlement of Ferenc-utca             
grew appreciably, there arose an aspiration to have their own school.             
This wish was soon fulfilled. Near the end of the previous century <i>[Ed.             
note: the 19th century]</i>, instruction was begun in rented premises;             
later school was held in the house of Schoolmaster Kremer. However, the             
number of children increased substantially, and the number of teaching             
staff expanded, so the room became too small, requiring the             
construction of a school building. For this purpose, the community of             
Serbisch-Zerne placed the Serbian leasehold farm in Ferenc-utca at             
their disposal, a beautiful site on which a two-class school and two             
teachers’ residences were to be built. The German population of             
Serbisch-Zerne eagerly went to work, and with heavy sacrifice, the             
school building was erected. Special merits in this regard were awarded             
to Franz Kremer, Sr. In 1909, they began instruction. The school was an             
autonomous community school. A school commission was to provide for its             
support.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1921, when all schools were nationalized, this             
school lost its autonomy and was annexed to the Serbian school system.             
Administratively, this had already occurred in 1919.</font></p>

The first             
settlers of our country were, for the most part, families rich in             
children; 10-12 children were not unusual. While the father as head of             
the family did his work in the field with the grown children, he also             
directed and managed the household; the mother cared for the small             
children, kept order in the house and yard, and took care of the bodily             
welfare of the household residents. If the children were able to help,             
then appropriate responsibilities would be assigned to them and they             
would be made to assist.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Our ancestors were very religious. Every Sunday and             
holy day everyone went to church except whoever was assigned to prepare             
the noon meal. After the meal on Sunday and holy days, the men gathered             
in the house, courtyard or at the inn for companionship; the women with             
their small children visited relatives, friends, or the neighborhood (<i>Majen</i>),             
while the grown children went dancing. The relationship between the             
parents and children and vice-versa was characterized by love. The word             
of the parents, especially the father, was highly respected, even after             
the children married. All these praiseworthy attributes changed over             
the course of time. In recent years, spiritual movements, circulated by             
written word and the press, influenced the thoughts and actions of man.             
Traditional attitudes, opinions, and values were abandoned as             
ridiculous and scorned. All of this did not occur without consequences.             
The earlier, deeply religious attitude and respect for elders —             
especially parents — suffered             
greatly, and was further aggravated by the spread of materialistic             
thoughts. In spite of this, our people, for the most part, remained             
true to the inbred virtues, customs, and morals of their ancestors and             
lived their lives accordingly.</font><br>

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All             
public merriment was introduced by <i>Kathrein</i>:             
they said, “Kathrein plays the violin.”</font><br>

the night before December 6, <i>[St.] Nikolaus</i>             
came. But we allowed this custom to get out of hand. That is to say, <i>Krampus             
[traditional devil-like figure]</i> appeared and at first scared the             
children, but afterwards gave them gifts.</font></div>

The most beautiful feast was <i>Christmas</i>. On the afternoon of             
Christmas Eve, a group of girls dressed in white trekked from house to             
house accompanied by the white (a youth dressed like a white rider on             
horseback) and the black (<i>Krampus</i>, with a sack full of <i>[whipping]</i>             
rods) and gave gifts to the children after they sang the Christ child             
song, which, unfortunately, was never recorded. After they left the             
house, they began searching under the Christmas tree for gifts. They             
had to see for themselves whether the long-anticipated wishes were             
fulfilled. At the evening meal, there was wine soup and afterwards             
poppy seed noodles and poppy seed or nut strudel. At midnight, the             
group went to early morning service. On the first or second day of             
Christmas, the children also received gifts from their godfathers and

It was celebrated in our sister communities in November on the Sunday             
after Martinmas <i>[November 11th]</i>. The reason for a feast on this             
date is thought to be that there should be a feast of joy and thanks             
for the harvest of the year since it was brought in with such pain and             
effort. The bouquets and ribbons on the hats of the <i>Kirchweih</i>             
boys and the wine bottles were symbols of the rich harvest. On these             
days visitors streamed in from all directions. After the rigorous days             
of work, it was the most appropriate time for relatives and friends to             
meet each other again, share joy and sorrows, counsel each other, and             
dedicate time to cheerfulness, fun, and conversation. The <i>Kirchweih</i>             
lasted three days; on this occasion, youth played the starring role.             
For weeks beforehand, the boys would search for a girl (<i>Kerweimensch</i>)             
for the <i>Kirchweih</i>. The <i>Kirchweih</i> fellows (<i>Kerweibuwe</i>)             
gathered together in an association and elected two treasurers, a hall             
and music was sought, and the cost was agreed upon between the host and             
musicians. On the Friday before the <i>Kerwei</i>, every <i>Kerwei</i>             
boy brought his hat to his <i>Kerwei</i> girl to groom (decorate). On             
Saturday afternoon, the youths gathered with the musicians in the             
courtyard of the community house to fetch the <i>Kirchweih</i> tree.             
With the brass band, they marched to the church square and set up the             
tree in front of the rectory. Afterwards, they went to pick up the             
decorated <i>Kirchweih</i> </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">bouquet </font></p>

girl. Then on that same evening, the first dance took place, this time,
however, without the decorated hat. On Sunday morning, every <i>Kerwei</i>
fellow visited his girl and received his decorated hat. Wearing this
hat and with the wine flask in hand, he then called on relatives and
godparents and offered them tickets for the drawing of hat and cloth.
Upon this opportunity, he received spending money for the <i>Kirchweih</i>
days. From the inn, the <i>Kirchweih</i> party then marched to the
church in front of the two treasurers. There they formed a receiving
line for the priest. During Mass, the fellows stood in the main
corridor of the church. The priest gave a sermon suitable for a festive
occasion. After the Mass, he was again honored through the receiving
line. Afterwards, honored guests were received: the pastor,
schoolmaster, municipal administrators, judge, and notary.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On Sunday afternoon, the <i>Kirchweih</i>             
associates left the inn with the musicians and girls to pick up the             
second treasurer, then his girl, then the first treasurer, and finally             
his girl. There the bouquet was picked up. Now marched the <i>Kirchweih</i>             
train with the first treasurer in front with his girl, who carried the             
bouquet, to the church square where an auction of the bouquet took             
place. During <i>Kirchweih</i> days, they stopped at every street             
corner and the musicians played a so-called corner song. A large group             
of people waited around the <i>Kirchweih</i> tree. At first, the             
second treasurer climbed on a barrel previously placed there and             
officiated at the drawing for hat and cloth. With jesting words, the             
attendees were encouraged to offer higher amounts for the soon-to-be             
auctioned lottery tickets. The drawing of the winning ticket was done             
by a child. During a short recess, the musicians played.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following this drawing was the auction of the             
bouquet. These were exciting moments for the fellows and girls, but             
also for their parents, even if their daughters or sons were not the             
owners of the bouquet. The drawing happened in the following manner.             
The first treasurer climbed on the barrel and gave his <i>Kirchweih</i>             
speech — while the musicians played a march. For many years this speech             
was arranged by the Schoolmaster, Michael Kremer — who died tragically.             
The speech consisted of humorous allusions and hilarious occurrences of

played a corner piece. Note here that <i>Kirchweih</i> members had to
pay the full declared price plus one-tenth of the difference between
the declared price and the cut-off price, whereas a successful bidder
from outside of the group had to pay the full cut-off price. It turned

around the <i>Kirchweih</i> tree, and after this the other fellows led             
their girls to dance. Then the whole group marched from the church             
square — in front of them was the pair of lead dancers with the bouquet             
— to the notable dignitaries and nearest relatives, to honor them with             
a rosemary sprig tied with silk ribbons, whereupon they were presented             
with money. The evening meal on Sunday was taken at the home of the             
female lead dancer, on Monday in the house of the male lead dancer.             
After the meal, they marched with the musicians to the dance hall. The             
first dance (three pieces) now belonged to the pair of lead dancers;             
also on the succeeding <i>Kirchweih</i> days these members of the

where it remained buried until the next <i>Kirchweih</i>. They took             
the <i>Kirchweih</i> tree on their shoulders and, to the sounds of a

After military service, it was time to think of marriage. If a fellow             
was not promised to a girl before that, then he looked around at the             
available girls. If his choice was agreed upon, then the parents got             
together. The parents on both sides met in the house of the chosen one             
and negotiated the dowry. If they agreed, then the promise (betrothal)             
of the young was made. This happened in close circles; only the parents             
on both sides and their counsel (marriage witnesses) assisted. The <br>

the agreed-upon dowry was put into writing in the presence of             
witnesses. The transfer of the dowry usually followed the marriage             
ceremony.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually the marriage took place three weeks after             
the betrothal. It was celebrated with more or less pageantry according             
to the means of the parents. If the number of guests was small, then             
the marriage would be celebrated in the house of the bride’s parents;             
if the number was large, then it took place at an inn. The marriage at             
the registry was usually done in the morning just in the presence of             
the witnesses, but the church marriage took place in the afternoon. It             
was a large wedding, 200 or more persons participating, when the             
marriage train marched to the church with music. The children went in             
front, then the bridesmaids with their partners, the bridal pair, after             
them followed the marriage witnesses, the married women, and finally             
the parents of the bride and groom. The pastor performed the marriage,             
gave a speech, and gave the blessings. Usually while still in the             
church, the elated participants wished the young couple well, the train             
was formed again, and they marched to the house or inn for the wedding             
meal. At the meal, the bridal pair sat at the head of the hall, next to             
them, the witnesses. During the meal, speeches were given in which best             
wishes were expressed for the bridal pair; children also recited poems             
on this opportune occasion.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the bridal dance, the bridegroom first led the             
bride in dance; then all of the guests asked the bride for a dance. At             
midnight, the veil and crown of the bride were removed and then the             
bridal pair symbolically stepped into the circle of those who were             
married. An earlier custom, to steal the bride’s shoe or to kidnap the             
bride herself, no longer happened in recent times. Either before or             
after the wedding, guests presented the bridal pair with a wedding             
present.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wedding — offering the finest food and beverages

The burial was done within 24 hours after death. After the ceremony in             
the church cemetery took place, the funeral cortege was set in motion.             
In front was carried the tomb cross, followed by the cross, flags,             
altar boys, the cantor, the pastor, in many cases the choir, musicians,             
then the men and finally, the women. The funeral cortege proceeded on             
the sidewalk, while the hearse traveled in the street. Behind it went             
the grief-stricken family. In many cases before the burial, a vesper of             
the dead for the salvation of the deceased was held in the church; then             
they continued to the graveyard. When they arrived there, the             
pallbearers lifted the coffin out of the hearse and carried it to the             
excavated grave or to the family vault, where the dead were interred             
after the church ceremony. Usually, six weeks after the burial, a             
requiem mass was read for the salvation of the deceased.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great reverence was shown to the family of a             
decedent. This resulted in a routine whereby they paid a visit to the             
grave at every opportunity to offer a prayer. Their graves were marked             
with marble gravestones, and the grave mount was planted with flowers.             
On All Saint’s Day, the graves were especially decorated beautifully.             
The graveyard looked like a flower garden.<br>

You all know that Cousin Matz had a vineyard, and you also know that he             
had wine. But I know that he always liked the wine at the inn better.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the spring, Cousin Nani put a young kitten — as             
we used to do back home — into a sieve — and covered it with an old             
sweater. Since she had to go to work in the vineyard and did not want             
Cousin Matz to find her money, she stuffed it into the sleeve of the             
sweater.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousin Matz was sitting in the <i>Gang</i>, smoking             
a cigarette, when the kitten suddenly started crying. Cousin Matz went             
into the stable where the cats were to see what happened.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cat was in the arm of the sweater and could not             
get out. As he was getting the cat out, he found the money.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quickly he went to the inn to drink a few glasses.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the evening, cousin Nani came home, looked for             
the cat and also for the money. The money was gone. She went into the             
house and said, “Matz, did you take the money out of the sleeve of that             
sweater?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousin Matz said, “What money? I did not find any             
money!"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousin Nani said, “But I put it into the sleeve of             
the sweater!"<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cousin Matz said, “ The cat must have eaten it.”<br>

Before the first World War, the Socialists marched             
through the village on May 1 with a red flag and music. The

Brother Joschko loved to go to the inn. The Schnapps and wine always             
tasted good to him. One fall evening, he was again at the innkeeper's             
and carousing happily. Several men from the fire department also showed             
up at the innkeeper's to drink a <i>Spitzer</i>.* After they drank             
their wine, they wanted to go home. When they came out of the common             
room into the vestibule — there were two doors, one that went into the             
dance hall and the other led outdoors — Brother Joschko came out of the             
dance hall and says, "It's cloudy and dark like being in a sack, I             
cannot see the moon or stars."<br>

Brother Mischko and Brother Jakob were good friends. They both really             
enjoyed drinking Schnapps as well. Brother Mischko was a blacksmith. In             
the fall, the farmers delivered the bounty, and since many also had a             
vineyard, they also brought along a bottle of Schnapps. Sister Amei,             
Brother Mischko's wife, had set the bottle in the pantry. There was             
already a whole row of liter bottles of Schnapps. Brother Jakob came to             
visit nearly every day. Brother Mischko would then let the anvil idle             
while they drank Schnapps. Sister Amei did not care for this, but she             
never said anything in the beginning. It eventually became too             
annoying, and she scolded the "Schnapps Brothers." When this had no             
effect, she hid a liter of Schnapps in the attic granary.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Brother Mischko also kept track of the bottles and could not find the             
missing one anywhere. He finally found it. When Sister Amei went out,             
he checked the attic, and sure enough, there it was in the grain. Out             
with it! And since Brother Jakob also came again to visit, it was             
quickly emptied. Brother Mischko filled the bottle with water and put             
it back in its place in the attic. The Schnapps was all gone when New             
Year's Day was approaching, so Brother Mischko asked Sister Amei, <br>

substantial library and also served Magyarization (Magyar speech club).             
The club had a stage where comedies, one-act plays, and theater events             
were performed in Hungarian and German. Festive events took place in             
its rooms. The opportunity was provided for many games, like chess,             
billiards, and cards, too. Magazines and daily newspapers were also

4. <i>Der Feuerwehrverein [The Fire Brigade Organization]</i> was             
brought into existence on March 16, 1884 at the suggestion of the             
estate manager Fabian, who also became president of the organization.             
The first equipment of the organization was obtained with the support             
of the lords of the manor. True to the slogan, “For the honor of God,             
for the protection of your neighbor,” it was the duty of the             
organization to protect the belongings of the inhabitants in adversity             
and danger. The organization fulfilled this duty within the limits of             
possibility in an exemplary manner up until World War I. Then their             
occupation was temporarily suspended since most of them had to march.             
Those draftees no longer carefully fulfilled their duties and the             
maintenance of their equipment and property. The task of the             
organization extended over all the territory of the sister community,             
and it was called the “German and Serbian Fire Brigade.” During the             
war, maintenance of the property of the organization was entrusted to             
the former commanding officer of the fire department, Franz Kremer, Sr.             
According to the by-laws, this property devolved to the first Fire             
Brigade, which was the property of one of the two communities. This             
happened in Deutsch-Zerne in 1923. (Since a fire brigade was also             
started in Serbisch-Zerne, this part of the property organizational             
maintenance was ceded to it.) At the startup, they acquired specific             
gains: Josef Themare, pharmacist, Franz Pronievicz, and Johann Bodwen.             
Its first officers were President Josef Themare, Commandant Johann             
Bodwen, and Secretary Franz Pronievicz. After Josef Themare retired,             
they elected Franz Pronievicz to the presidency; Professor Hans Tabar             
became secretary. In 1928, the organization's <br>

Brigade Association in our community, the county Fire Brigade             
Association was founded. Our town commanding officer, Johann Bodwen,

formed a glee club that also served as the church choir under the             
direction of the current organists (cantors). The club existed until             
1909. In 1921, the Men’s Singing Group was born. Its first member was             
Josef Themare. In the beginning, the group was independent, but later             
they joined with the Fire Department song group. The group soon             
flourished, hosted song evenings and Sunday presentations, and             
participated in songfests with various groups. It always presented             
remarkable events. The chairmen of the group were Josef Themare,             
Philipp Rausch, and finally, Anton Bodwen. The choir directors were             
Schoolmaster Michael Horvath, Jakob Reppa, and Michael Kremer.<br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The presentation of these dilettantes enjoyed great             
popularity. The performance of one-act plays, stories, comedies, and             
melodramas always found a grateful and zesty audience. Especially             
noteworthy in this regard are the efforts of Schoolmaster Michael             
Kremer who even translated comical pieces about the rural world,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The <i>Kulturbund</i> <i>[Culture League]</i>             
or its full name, “Schwabisch-German Culture League,” was founded in             
the lowlands, and by-and-by its organization expanded. In our area, it             
was established in 1920. Its goal was considered to be the fostering of             
cultural interests of the Germans. <br>

also the </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">designated             
legal representative of academic autonomy,             
whereby the state transferred sovereign right over the German schools             
to it. It was intended that the Serbians also possess school autonomy             
in the monarchy. These rights were even guaranteed to the leading men             
of our people by the peace treaty. Afterwards, they would hear nothing             
of it and deliberately hindered the expansion of our school system. The             
sanctions of the regime at that time narrowed our prospects for making             
our school system successful. By order of the administration dated July             
20, 1920 (through 1921), all schools were socialized; ownership of             
school property by a community and church was made illegal,             
expropriated without compensation, and transferred to the hand of the             
state. Now the state could unscrupulously enforce its criminal intent,             
of which the chauvinist minister, Pribićević, availed himself. The             
primary freedoms we had been taught in school were taken away bit by             
bit, the operation of the Culture League was discontinued, and its             
property was confiscated. Later, when the Culture League was again             
permitted to operate as a result of the combative efforts of German             
representatives, it could no longer fully perform the tasks allowed in             
our area. There was no other alternative than this in any other             
organization, respectively, to relocate groups. The Serbians simply             
would not tolerate Germans continuing to be taught in their own             
language. They spied on every cultural event, harassed the leading men,             
made it difficult to get permits, and caused disruptions. Not until the             
end of 1930 could the Culture League display a healthy activity.             
Shortly thereafter, it was completely absorbed into a country group.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last chairman of the Culture League was Michael             
Schulz; the country director was Johann Hepp.<br>

Music was also supported in the <i>Hausmusik             
[Music-Making at Home]</i>. Instruments like the harmonica, accordion,             
and piano were used. In small groups, the fiddle was also played. In             
the previous century, there had been a <i>Musikkapelle [music band]</i>             
under the direction of Bandmaster Müller. They played at dances and             
various festivals and family celebrations. This band had dissolved and,             
at the beginning of this century <i>[20th]</i>, Bandmaster Johann             
Konrad started a new band. Soon he succeeded in creating a powerful             
music group of young fellows. They also played at <br>

point in their success. They performed many concerts and were sought             
after as a dance band. The band was even invited to play on a radio             
broadcast. Unfortunately, the program could not be aired due to adverse             
circumstances. Due to disputes, a part of the group separated and             
formed a new band under the name <i>Männerkapelle [Men’s Band]</i>.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>Leichenverein [Death Benefit Group]</i> had             
the task of providing proper burials to the deceased and payment of a             
specific amount to the family survivors. The amount necessary for this             
was supplied by contributions from its members.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The president of the group was Johann Stein,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Miscellaneous:</i> 1. In 1898, the             
Hatzfeld-Betschkerek <i>Schmalspurbahn [narrow-gage railway]</i> was             
built. After the removal of Hatzfeld <i>[from consideration]</i>,             
Deutsch-Zerne became the terminus. But then in 1920, they extended the             
line to Klarija, which then became the terminus. This railway kept             
gaining more importance due to its fast transport of people and goods.             
To no small extent did the depot of the Credit Cooperative at the             
railway station contribute to this. The best-known stationmasters were             
Kardos, Matthias Szigeti, and Josef Fuderer.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In the previous century, there was a <i>Poststelle             
[post office]</i> in our sister communities. Mail was delivered to us             
through neighboring Hatzfeld. Later we received our own post office,             
from which mail to neighboring Hetin was deployed. The managers of the             
post office were: Irene von Majlath, Emilie Konstantinović, Hermine             
Harlamov, née Jung, and Nevenka Vinković, née Rajkov. Long-standing             
employees were: Eva Paul, Antonia Kiefer, Berta Hirhager, and Anna             
Kampf. Postmen in the final years were: Anton Sehr, Sr., Peter Kampf,             
and Ludwig Bach.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>             
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The <i>Gendarmerie [constabulary or rural police]</i>             
managed public order and safety and the protection of property. A             
police station had previously been built in our sister community.</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. A station of <i>Finanzkontrolle [Finance Control]</i>             
stood earlier in Hatzfeld. As our community became a frontier town, a             
station was also built here. It provided a sentry at the border for             
traffic both ways and battled against tobacco and border smuggling.</font></p>

On September 1, 1939, the political antagonism between Germany and             
Poland led to the outbreak of World War II.&nbsp; The Poles allied             
themselves with England and France; and other states followed later,             
taking one side or the other, so that soon the whole world was             
aflame.&nbsp; Yugoslavia remained neutral and, at the beginning of             
1941, the Viennese government signed the so-called Vienna Pact and             
committed itself to neutrality.&nbsp; The upper military circles in the             
country, who thirsted for glory, were against this pact and contrived a             
coup under the leadership of General Simović, forcing Prince Regent             
Paul to leave the country and allowing the 18 year old Crown Prince             
Peter to succeed as king.&nbsp; The Simović government even closed a             
friendship pact with the Soviet Union.&nbsp; In Belgrade, mass             
demonstrations of agitated people took place.&nbsp; With shouts of,             
“Bolje rat, nego Pakt” (Better war than the pact), the demonstrations             
degenerated into an unequivocal rally against Germany.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In reply to these incidents, the imperial government declared war on             
Yugoslavia and ordered the bombing of Belgrade.&nbsp; Early in the             
morning of Palm Sunday, April 6, 1941, when heavy German aircraft             
formations roared over our heads, we knew what was wrong:&nbsp; Germany             
and Yugoslavia were at war.&nbsp; At lightning speed the affirmation of             
this news spread from official quarters.&nbsp; This had a paralyzing             
affect on the German people.&nbsp; They knew what a dangerous situation             
this could be for them.&nbsp; The first war sanctions soon             
followed.&nbsp; All radios and firearms belonging to Germans had to be             
surrendered immediately.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The             
following men were seized from both villages as hostages and carried             
off in carts from Julia-major to Peterwardein under the gun turrets of             
the fortress.&nbsp; With the swift advance of German military units,             
they were quickly freed and brought back to their homeland after 8 days.</font><br>

the hostages snatched away than armed Sokol youths spread over the             
area, gathered all the men that they could get hold of, took them to             
the train station and crammed them into two railroad cars.&nbsp; For 48             
long hours they were held captive there under the persistent threat of             
massacre.&nbsp; In a spirited discourse, the Serbian pastor from             
Alexandrovo in the Banat succeeded in persuading the guards that they             
should be released.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
After these events peace prevailed in the area, but             
apprehension about the future was noticeable.&nbsp; When the             
constabulary left town, leaving no one in charge of order and safety,             
the community leaders met and agreed to provide security in both parts             
of Zerne, wearing mingled stripes (1 Serbian and 1 German), and             
contributing to the reassurance of the population.&nbsp; However, that             
only lasted a few days and then the first German units appeared.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
During the years 1941—1942, German men fit for             
military service were enlisted as constabulary whose job it was to             
preserve peace and security, but most of them were conscribed into the             
newly formed “Prince Eugen Division.”&nbsp; This unit was used against             
Yugoslavian partisans and fought shoulder to shoulder with German armed             
forces until the end of the war.&nbsp; After the surrender, the members             
of this division became prisoners of war.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
The absence of the majority of men resulted in a             
lack of workers.&nbsp; To forestall a production shortage, Serbian             
workers were obliged to serve the German land management.&nbsp; They             
were used in farm work.&nbsp; To provide relief for housewives, groups             
of German girls were provided under the guidance of the people’s group             
leadership.&nbsp; One such group was on mission with us.&nbsp; Its             
leader was Barbara Mayer of Stefansfeld.&nbsp; The girls worked in             
homes from morning until early afternoon.&nbsp; They were also allotted             
education time 2-3 times a week.&nbsp; This was entrusted to             
Schoolmaster Hans Tabar and Schoolmistress Elisabeth Fulda.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To             
make an equitable amount of provisions available,             
commissioners were appointed at the wheat threshing to record the level             
of harvest results.&nbsp; Even meat consumption was limited.&nbsp;             
Textiles, as well as shoes and leather goods, could only be purchased             
with ration cards.</font><br>

activity in the Banat was virtually unknown at the beginning of the             
occupation. However, over the course of time it became blatant.&nbsp;             
To prevent it, a “German team” of those unfit for military service and             
older men was established.&nbsp; Their task was to assist the police in             
maintaining law and order on a local level.&nbsp; If necessary, they             
could also be used in larger deployments at other locations.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In             
the summer of 1944 events occurred rapidly.&nbsp;             
Due to the growing deterioration of the war situation, Romania             
surrendered, Russians occupied the territory after a forced march, and             
danger was imminent to us all.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It             
was planned that, in case of a threat of enemy             
occupation, the German populace would evacuate in their wagons but the             
schoolchildren would go by train.&nbsp; For inexplicable reasons, this             
did not happen; merely one transport of schoolchildren, with 2 youths             
under the direction of Schoolmaster Tabar and Schoolmistress Fulda,             
could escape in the final hours.&nbsp; The beginning of this journey             
can be read in the article, “Der Zusammenbruch nähert sich” <i>[The             
Collapse Approaches]</i>.&nbsp; The further fate of this transport             
follows:&nbsp; many high-quality groceries (meal, fat, ham, bacon) that             
had been loaded into a baggage car remained standing for a long time in             
Betschkerek, the other things such as tailored clothing, probably at             
Theiss-strand in Aradac.&nbsp; The workers there refused to load our             
things onto the ship for the reason that they had already been working             
continuously for 3 days and nights and could no longer continue.&nbsp;             
After they were pacified with 10,000 dinar <i>[Ed. note: about $40.00             
U.S.]</i> and friendly persuasion, they accepted the work.&nbsp;             
Unfortunately, I have a justifiable suspicion that a good part of our             
luggage did not arrive on the ship but landed instead in the shore-side             
woods.&nbsp; The remainder that we brought to Werbass was entrusted to             
a guard troop under command of transport management to bring our things             
up the Danube to Germany.&nbsp; In this case, we apparently trusted the             
cat to keep the cream, as was later learned.</font><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact that a severe test was approaching for our             
people was already apparent in 1942 with the defeat of             
Stalingrad.&nbsp; After that, the German armed forces lost faith in             
their fortunes of war.&nbsp; The retreat movements began, the enemy             
became visibly stronger, their war successes multiplied.&nbsp; While,             
at the beginning of the hostilities the German Air Force was confident             
they were capable of dominating their own and hostile airspace, the             
situation gradually changed.&nbsp; An undeniable shift in power             
occurred.&nbsp; The production centers of the enemy manufactured a vast             
number of aircraft and other materials needed for the leadership of the             
air war.&nbsp; Their flight personnel also multiplied continually, and             
even the hardest blows of the German Air Force could not bring about a             
change.&nbsp; Already the enemy was in position to carry out heavy             
retaliatory strikes without being hindered.&nbsp; Soon the power             
balance of the strong, yes, the superiority of the enemy, was evident.<br>

&nbsp;The German fleet could not even compare with enemy fleets.&nbsp;             
They, of course, scored tremendous successes, but because of their             
diverse responsibilities, they also scored painful losses.&nbsp; <br>

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So             
it slowly came to the point where the enemy was in a position to             
produce a vast number of weapons and war materials without interference             
in territories that were inaccessible to the Germans, while Germany,             
with its allies and its territorial possessions, was caught up more and

thousands of casualties.</font><br>

size of the enemy armed forces grew steadily, their pool of men             
seemingly inexhaustible, while the last of our able-bodied men had             
already been recruited.&nbsp; The inevitable result was a military             
setback.&nbsp; In 1943 the Italian military was eliminated.&nbsp; The             
Anglo-American invasion in the West and the Soviet Russian offensive in             
the East, begun in 1944, drove German troops back to the pre-war German             
border.&nbsp; The greater the military success of the opponent, the             
more sabotage and partisan activities flared up in the territorial             
possessions and soon the allies left.</font><br>

Our final decision came in the late summer of 1944.&nbsp; The Russians             
stood at the border of the Banat, partisan activity increased             
noticeably.&nbsp; In our sister communities, there were raids in the

About two weeks before this, our village train had pulled out of             
Romania.&nbsp; It stopped to rest and stayed there overnight.&nbsp;             
Everything was well organized.&nbsp; Men from the people’s group             
leadership appeared, paid the train operator, assembled escapees, made             
statements to them and gave them advice.&nbsp; The wagons stood ready

Around midnight on the evening of September 30 to October 1, I was             
awakened by the security service officer living in our house and             
informed that the children booked for the children’s transport would be             
able to start their journey on the next train.&nbsp; Since I was             
scheduled as the trip leader for this transport, I took the necessary             
precautions and gathered the children together at the train station             
punctually at 12:30.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the train was very late and             
we left around 2:30.&nbsp; According to earlier instructions, we took             
along lots of high-quality groceries in a freight car.&nbsp; My task as             
transport leader was to take all the groups of children by railway to             
Betschkerek.&nbsp; The train chugged along slowly.&nbsp; Finally we             
reached the first German community, Tschestelek.&nbsp; The station was             
full of people, but no children to travel with us.&nbsp; An opposite             
train was in the station.&nbsp; Passengers and sightseers tried to             
persuade me to return.&nbsp; I tried to contact the school official,             
but the entire public telephone system had stopped working.&nbsp; So we             
traveled farther.&nbsp; In St. George the last group of children             
climbed aboard, under the direction of Schoolmaster Josef Feimer.&nbsp;             
Neither in Kathreinfeld nor in Klek did more children climb in.&nbsp;             
In Klek, light artillery stood along the railway embankment.&nbsp;             
During the journey we could also observe how Stukas <i>[dive bombers]</i>             
fired at Lazarfeld.&nbsp; Finally we came to the Betschkerek sugar             
factory.&nbsp; The railroad station was crammed with railcars.&nbsp;             
The waiting period was lasting an extremely long time, so I approached             
the stationmaster.&nbsp; This person was a staff sergeant in the Armed             
Forces and a civilian teacher, as it turned out.&nbsp; I asked for the             
cause for the delay, whereupon he answered, “You are definitely not in             
a desirable situation.&nbsp; Our tank platoon attempted a raid 4 km             
from here and was so damaged by the Russians that it is now in need of             
repair.&nbsp; It is standing on the bridge and blocking the             
continuation of your journey.&nbsp; As soon as the damages are repaired             
and the platoon passes, the way will be clear for you.”&nbsp; It did             
not take all that long before the massive tank platoon crept past us             
and, in a few minutes, we reached the main station.</font><br>

I had hoped that arrangements or instructions awaited us there.&nbsp;             
Not at all!&nbsp; The group from St. George — they had even less             
baggage — got separated from us and </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">steered the way to the

leader to try to understand our situation and help us.&nbsp; There were             
long, anxious minutes, but nothing stirred him.&nbsp; Finally I decided             
to act without his assistance.&nbsp; The view upon arrival appeared to             
be a harrowing scene of confusion.&nbsp; But time pressed on.&nbsp;             
Eventually I met a man who even in this situation had a clear             
head:&nbsp; Dr. Adam Maurus, director of the education office.&nbsp;             
With his help, I succeeded in persuading a few LKW-s of the armed             
forces unit to drive us to the Theiss.&nbsp; We drove off and, as we             
crossed the train track before the station, I asked that officer where             
was our group of children.&nbsp; He said to drive on, that: “They are             
surely already gone?”&nbsp; At my plea, he let me climb out and they             
drove off.&nbsp; I was again deeply frustrated and my hopes sank to             
nothing.&nbsp; Only a glimmer of hope sustained me, the assurance of             
Dr. Maurus that he would not abandon us.&nbsp; In the pouring rain, in             
the pitch-dark night, every minute seemed like an eternity.&nbsp; How             
difficult it was to keep up the spirits of the children!&nbsp;             
Fortunately, the whole group did not suspect what danger hovered near             
us during those past several hours.<br>             
      </font></div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Finally, a truck approached us.&nbsp; It was our rescue!&nbsp;             
Schoolteacher Hans Rasimus boarded the vehicle and, in two trips, we             
arrived at the River Theiss near Arad with some of our luggage.&nbsp;             
Most of it had to be left behind at the train station.&nbsp; As the             
last ones to board the tugboat, we were expected by Dr. Maurus and our             
arduous journey began.<br>

Our experiences demonstrate how helpless and perplexed our people’s             
group leadership was at confronting a situation during those days, but             
they also show how unsympathetically the armed forces regarded our             
position.</font><br>

consisting of the neighboring Deutsch-Zerne and Serbisch-Zerne, had             
altogether 1,929 German inhabitants in 1944.&nbsp; When the order to             
evacuate came in the evening of October 1, 1944, the designated escape             
route through Grossbetschkerek was already cut off.&nbsp; Only a few             
people fled over the nearby border to Romania before the invasion of

yard at Neuhausen, also known as Julia-major, property that at that             
time belonged to the upper group leader, so the partisans             
withdrew.&nbsp; These were not regular partisans but settlers from

had taken up residence in the Catholic rectory after the priest, along             
with 6 other men, was shot on October 4.&nbsp; The priest was Franz             
Brunet, born in Modosch; the others were:&nbsp; Bela Köstner, timber

Before the Russians got there, nothing remarkable had occurred.&nbsp;             
Immediately after the partisans left, the Serbians came to an agreement             
with the Germans and proclaimed that, no matter what, they would not             
allow anything happen to anyone.&nbsp; If the armed forces should             
return, likewise nothing should happen to any Serbian.&nbsp; As a             
result, Germans believed that if partisans or Russians came, Serbians             
would see that nothing happened to any German.&nbsp; A German and a             
Serbian went from house to house and announced this for             
reassurance.&nbsp; Hans Jost came to our house with a Serbian who was             
unknown to me.&nbsp; This agreement was made on October 4 when there             
were no military units in the area.</font><br>

Similar agreements were also made between local Germans and Serbians in             
other villages of mixed nationality.&nbsp; They had been made and kept             
during the German-Yugoslavian War of April 1941, too.&nbsp; For days             
after that, the Serbians awaited the Russians invasion and gathered             
together for that reason.&nbsp; About nine o’clock, as they were             
assembled, the German military came into the village and shot at the

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
This incident was presented differently in other accounts.&nbsp;             
According to them, destruction was perpetrated in the Serbisch             
community by this detachment of German soldiers who had come from the             
nearby Romanian border at Hatzfeld where a few Germans had fled.&nbsp;             
Five Serbisch men at the border and six in the village committed             
suicide.</font><br>
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
About eleven o’clock the Russians arrived and, right after that, they             
seized seven men who were shot late that evening.&nbsp; According to             
other reports, there were six German men who were also shot, among them             
Father Brunet, whom they claimed had been shot in front of the church             
steeple during the morning of the invasion of the German military             
division.&nbsp; I do not know if the men were questioned before being             
shot, but I doubt it based upon what happened later.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
During the day the Russians just marched through.&nbsp; But at night             
they invaded and plundered German homes.&nbsp; No one resisted             
them.&nbsp; On the very first night, Russians raped the women.&nbsp;             
The local gypsies did not plunder in the beginning nor did they violate             
the women.&nbsp; That first night the Russians came to our house,             
too.&nbsp; I hid in the straw with a neighbor.&nbsp; No one was in the             
house, only in the tinsmith’s workshop of my men.&nbsp; They took             
whatever food was handy and the bed linens from a nearby bed.&nbsp;             
Other things were tossed about.&nbsp; My other neighbor E. S. told me             
that Russians also plundered their house and raped a woman.&nbsp; There             
were two Russians, both of whom abused the woman while they held her at             
gunpoint.</font><br>
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Here is an account of the recorded statement of E. S.&nbsp; Because of             
the rapes — various statements reported a number of especially barbaric             
rapes, among them one of a nine year old girl — an exceptionally large             
number of women and entire families committed suicide out of shame and             
despair.</font><br>

The next day, Friday, inhabitants of the nearby colonial villages that             
had been resettled on the former property of Count Csekonics in 1921             
came with the Russians.&nbsp; They began to plunder with Russian             
assistance so that in many a home, everything was literally dragged

Serbians only weakly participated.&nbsp; Allegedly, the plundering             
actually ceased that day due to intervention by the local             
Serbians.&nbsp; On that day German men were abducted and shot in the             
parish hall.&nbsp; In the evening, rapes by the Russians decreased             
considerably.</font><br>
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
On Saturday afternoon, two local Serbians armed with rifles came with a             
woman from the area and took me and two other women who were in the             
courtyard to the parish hall.&nbsp; When we entered, there were already             
eleven women present.&nbsp; Just as we came in, they brought the first             
dead out of the cellar and tossed them onto a wagon.&nbsp; A Serbian             
woman, about seventeen years old, and a gypsy called upon us to sing;             
otherwise we would be shot.&nbsp; Therefore, we sang a song, then we             
sang a second, and we repeated until all the dead were loaded onto the             
wagon.&nbsp; There were five men.&nbsp; We were not allowed to see who             
they were and my friend later told me on the way back that Josef             
Hoffman, the locksmith, was among them.&nbsp; Still later we heard that             
the others were Heinrich Tides, a laborer (shot because he was a             
juror), Anton Schulz, a farmer, Heinrich Schulz, a farmer, and Stefan             
Bischof, a farmer.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
As the dead were loaded onto the wagon — and with the singing over, two             
of us were now forced to clap our hands behind the wagon —, a Serbian             
woman came, slapped the young Serbian in the face and shoved him             
against the door without saying a word.&nbsp; Another, in a brown             
uniform, ordered us to stop.&nbsp; Seven women were made to climb into             
the wagon.&nbsp; The others had to remove the bloodstains in the             
courtyard.&nbsp; I was on the wagon.&nbsp; Two Serbians and a gypsy             
walked next to the wagon.&nbsp; Only the dead and the women were in the             
wagon.&nbsp; We drove to the Schinderplatz where the remains of a horse             
had been buried earlier, unloaded the dead and drove back; our escort             
walked beside the wagon until we reached the parish hall.&nbsp; Outside             
we saw where three burials had probably taken place in conspicuous             
areas on the ground.&nbsp; As we unloaded the dead, a large crowd of             
gypsies stood around with shovels.&nbsp; One of them wanted to             
immediately strip a dead body.&nbsp; When a male companion stopped him,             
he begged to be allowed just the trousers, which the companion also             
refused.&nbsp; No doubt the dead were buried naked since that man later             
left </font><br>

the time we got back home, it was already dark.&nbsp; I had hardly             
finished eating when two Serbians arrived with a Russian soldier and             
began asking questions, whereby it soon became obvious that the Russian             
had actually come for my daughter who had fled.&nbsp; Since they could             
not find her, the Russian attacked us and, as we ran, a Serbian shouted             
that the young lady should remain.&nbsp; This upset my neighbor, but             
she rebuffed them and ran away.&nbsp; Across the alley from the             
courtyard where I had run, I saw them go into the house, plunder it,             
and throw everything around.</font><br>

In the second part of the testimony, the witness later stated:&nbsp; I             
forgot to mention that rapes were committed mostly by the Russian and             
only partly by the gypsy.&nbsp; At first, a partisan tried to rape a             
woman but was prevented and incarcerated by their leader Ljubica.&nbsp;             
I do not know what happened about it later.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Because of the disgraceful actions of the Russians and partisans, about             
50 people hung themselves.&nbsp; In one house, Kaspar Rothenbach, about             
70 years old, his wife Eva, his son Johann, the son’s wife Maria, and             
their daughters Maria and Susanna hung themselves.</font><br>

The written testimony of farmer Josef Kampf (November 15, 1946), and             
the later statements (1956) compiled by him , cite the names of 48             
persons from Deutsch-Zerne who&nbsp; committed suicide in one             
night.&nbsp; In the written testimony of E. W. and K. B. of             
Deutsch-Zerne (January and March 1952), on the first day after the             
occupation, the number of suicides due to the threat of imprisonment             
and shooting by partisans. and rape by Soviet soldiers and gypsies, is             
indicated as 54:&nbsp; 46 persons, men, women and children, are named             
here.&nbsp; The former civil servant, Jakob Nickels, wrote in his             
testimony (April 2, 1958) that in Deutsch-Zerne 57 persons, including 6             
children between the ages of 2 and 10, committed suicide.</font><br>

According to the statements of P. B. (September 22, 1946), some weeks

still plundered more.&nbsp; After eight days there was peace.&nbsp; I             
no longer left the house.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The             
grapes from the wine gardens were all cut, taken to Julia-major and             
processed.&nbsp; Their owners were forbidden to take the grapes.&nbsp;             
It was made known by drumbeat that plundering was forbidden, that             
everyone should report cases of plundering.&nbsp; However, when reports             
were made, people were dismissed with remarks that the plunderer must             
have taken things for the military, and so nothing was done.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
The drumbeat called for more clothes, more laundry, more poultry, more             
eggs, etc., to be delivered.&nbsp; Often the people brought so much             
that many items had to be taken back, because the present need&nbsp;             
had been filled, so later the demand was targeted just toward certain             
parts of the village.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
Around October 15, all people between the ages of 15 and 60 were made             
to go to work.&nbsp; It was done collectively, corn cracked, corn husks             
cut, potatoes stubbed.&nbsp; Even in winter we had to go daily, all men             
as well as women, to report for work at the community center.&nbsp; The             
necessary number of workers was kept, the rest was sent home.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On             
October 22, about 150 men from Zerne and other local villages, who had             
been kept in the community house cellar, were shot, this time at             
Schinderplatz.&nbsp; Several reports are available about this mass             
shooting.&nbsp; It took place on October 24; two days after a mass             
grave had been dug.&nbsp; The exact number of those shot cannot be             
determined to this day.&nbsp; In the description of his experiences

The course of events of this mass shooting is reported in the written             
testimony of farmer Josef Kampf as follows:&nbsp; On that day,             
shootings were carried out in all German villages in the surrounding             
area.&nbsp; In Nemačka Crnja, they led persons assigned for execution             
to the courtroom bound together with ropes.&nbsp; The columns marching             
to execution were conveyed to the right and left by gypsies who were             
provided with clubs.&nbsp; During the march, the gypsies could satisfy             
their grievances and they did so liberally.&nbsp; The gypsies put             
particular weight into bludgeoning individuals as they passed their own             
houses.&nbsp; If someone collapsed unconscious, he was then carried             
along by others with the rope.&nbsp; Gypsies also used their clubs             
until the injured man got to his feet.&nbsp; Every now and then, if one             
of the beaten could go no further, he was taken to the courthouse by             
wagon.&nbsp; All the church bells rang with mockery.&nbsp; Alongside             
the death column, Serbian men and boys rode with cowbells that clanked             
in discordant harmony.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
At the courthouse, the victims were made to undress; any unable to do             
so were stripped by the gypsies.&nbsp; Then the condemned stood in             
groups of five or six before the mass grave where they were shot with             
submachine guns and with single shots from behind.&nbsp; On the meadow             
around the Schinderplatz stood hundreds of Serbian spectators to the             
occasion.&nbsp; The next group had to push the previous corpses into             
the pit if they had not fallen after being shot.&nbsp; However, there             
were many in the grave who were not yet dead.&nbsp; Several arose and             
turned about in their death agonies, causing laughter among the             
spectators . . .&nbsp; Dirt was not thrown on the corpses since room             
had to be left for the next set of victims.</font><br>

The written testimony of A. W. of Deutsch-Zerne states:&nbsp; Since I             
lived near the village gate, I went to the attic with some others and             
looked out at the Schinderplatz.&nbsp; There I saw people being             
undressed by the gypsies, having their shoes removed in the community             
center, and having to run barefoot to the courthouse.&nbsp; After they             
were unclothed, they were first bludgeoned by the gypsies with clubs,             
then made to run toward the mass grave and, while running, they were             
shot by a man in a trench coat who had a submachine gun.&nbsp; People             
were not examined as to whether or not they were dead but were all             
thrown into the grave.&nbsp; Many men fell, however, before they were             
wounded, apparently&nbsp; fainting with fright.&nbsp; Ljubica, the             
local partisan leader, would then shoot them on the ground.&nbsp; I

and probably begged for his life, which did not help at all.&nbsp; He             
had to turn again and was finished off by a shot to the neck.&nbsp;             
Three transports of people were executed.&nbsp; The shooting began at 4             
o’clock.&nbsp; By nightfall, the second transport was still not             
finished, and the third was dispatched by moonlight.&nbsp; At             
nightfall, I left my eavesdropping post on the ground, but I heard             
shooting until almost 9 o’clock.&nbsp; Then the partisans, singing             
Serbisch songs, drove back to the village in three wagons.</font><br>

We were all recorded there.&nbsp; Some were selected as workers in the

taken to Julia-major.&nbsp; The rest were marched towards Heufeld under

to go home again, without an escort.&nbsp; However, since only five             
wagons were available for people from Zerne, many children had to run             
and others had to be carried.&nbsp; So on November 19 we returned home,             
everyone to his own house.&nbsp; Most houses, however, had been             
thoroughly plundered.&nbsp; When we left our keys, notes with names and

anything he or she still owned.&nbsp; The livestock remained at the             
houses, and every family had to feed its own.&nbsp; However, in many             
houses the livestock had been taken from Julia-major to Neuhausen             
(owned by a Jew in 1941), which was kept as communal property covering

On April 18, 1945, everyone was ordered to take one day’s food to the             
Schleimer’s inn.&nbsp; There they confiscated everything, including the             
clothes that we wore.&nbsp; Everyone had to take off extra clothing,             
and their money, jewelry, earrings, and baggage, even their provisions             
down to a piece of bread, were taken away.&nbsp; They even took my             
linen thread and needle.&nbsp; We stayed overnight in the inn, the             
school, and other places.&nbsp; The next morning, everyone was marched             
outside to the meadow, which was surrounded by machine guns.&nbsp;             
Children up to age two remained with their mothers, from ages 2 to 15             
were separated and divided into three age groups.&nbsp; Those children             
were then assigned to be cared for by people over age 50.&nbsp; People             
up to age 50 were put into the class of workers, men and women             
separately.</font><br>

A group of 30 younger women was also separated and transported on the             
following day to Kalvarienberg Camp in Semlin (Zemum) where several             
such transports arrived at the same time from various villages in the             
Banat.&nbsp; After several weeks, they were dispersed from there to a             
work camp in Syrmien.&nbsp; The majority of these women and girls died             
in the winter of 1945/46 (see Report Number 585), many in the central             
warehouse of Sremska Mitrovica.</font><br>

several statements about the general internment in Deutsch-Zerne, it             
was reported that some days later, older women and men were removed to             
the medical camp in Kathreinfeld.&nbsp; A group of over 20 older men             
who had announced themselves ill were probably murdered on the way             
there (see also Report Number 39, Section 237, Note 15).</font><br>

When we had been separated, we went to the prepared camps and houses             
assigned to us.&nbsp; I came into a house of 100 women, becoming woman             
number 101.&nbsp; We took straw from the yards for a couch.&nbsp; No             
one got bed linen.&nbsp; Only the linen in baby carriages was left for             
the infants.&nbsp; Later we received carpets that we had made from rags             
for covering ourselves earlier in the village.&nbsp; This is how we

alley by the stables, and people over age 50 were appointed to feed             
them.&nbsp; Feeding took place without guards.&nbsp; At 4 o’clock in

vegetable or something similar.&nbsp; Over time the meal became more             
scant so that we got only 30 grams of flour each.&nbsp; Bread given at             
the beginning contained 60 decagrams, then it was reduced, and finally             
it was only 10 decagrams.&nbsp; Bread was made from mixing flour with

Soon after, the first transports of Serbians from Bosnia and Montenegro             
arrived.&nbsp; They were invited as new residents to settle into the             
homesteads of ousted Germans.&nbsp; The merchant, Matthias Kaiser (see             
Report Number 39), reported the following information about this:</font><br>

In the winter of 1945/46, new colonists (from Bosnia) came to Zerne to             
settle into the deserted German homes and take over the livestock,             
fields, and agricultural devices previously owned by the Germans.&nbsp;             
Before these colonists arrived, native Serbians were summoned by the             
partisan authorities and, in accordance with the newly developed             
“Narodna Dobare” (i.e., People’s Welfare Administration), were             
requested to donate food such as eggs, chickens, lard, and other items             
to welcome their new brothers and sisters, and to share their own             
cooking and baking with the newcomers so that they would feel at home             
in their new place of residence.&nbsp; However, when it was announced             
that the first transport would arrive in Zerne in 2-3 hours, the             
leading authorities developed an indescribable stupidity.&nbsp; They             
observed with great astonishment that only a few local Serbians             
complied with the request to donate foodstuffs, and scarcely 10-12             
women had appeared to be personal aides at the reception inn.&nbsp;             
Also, none of the Serbian men and women appointed to light fires in the             
stoves of the deserted homes showed up.&nbsp; All of the planned             
preparations were unsuccessful.&nbsp; And why the native Serbians did             
not participate in the welcoming ceremonies is very </font><br>

Later in the evening, after our nightly meal, the Kuljic came to our             
camp with some partisans and forced about 40 camp people into the             
referenced houses to light the stoves.&nbsp; About 15 women had to go             
immediately to the reception inn in order to cook and serve the meal to             
the newcomers, and afterwards they even had to accompany them to their

Then several more transports arrived, and there was intense activity             
daily as colonists received furniture, bed linens, clothes and food             
from the warehouses.&nbsp; Afterwards, cows, horses and pigs were             
allotted to them.&nbsp; All of the above-mentioned originated from us             
Swabians, and the camp folks had to calmly transport things from the             
warehouses to the houses of the colonists and set up their rooms for             
them.</font><br>
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
There were even cases where the camp folks had to transport furniture             
that had once been their very own.&nbsp; We were constantly occupied             
with the colonists.&nbsp; Our camp folks were daily scheduled to teach             
these dumb people everything, for they had not the faintest idea about             
farming or how to feed livestock, how to milk a cow, or how to yoke             
horses to a wagon or plow, for which you really could not blame them             
for they came from the mountain regions of Bosnia and Montenegro.</font><br>             
      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The             
internment camp in Zerne was closed on March 18, 1946.&nbsp; Altogether             
167 persons, among them 30 younger women and five youths aged 12, were             
taken into custody as agricultural workers by the National Welfare             
Administration; the rest of the internees, among them people over age

typhus.&nbsp; M. M. listed around 68 deaths in the Werschetz group             
(among them 54 women) from March 18, 1945 to February 28, 1946;             
according to this list of names (which the witness remarked was not             
complete), 9 persons died at the end of November; 23 in December; 37 in             
January; 9 persons in February; 11 were children up to age 14, 22 were             
persons over age 50.</font><br>

People from Zerne were mostly housed in Molidorf stables.&nbsp; We were             
allowed to move freely about the village.&nbsp; All of the people who             
had been there longer were malnourished, emaciated, the children             
jaundiced and anemic; one could see the hunger in their eyes.&nbsp; The             
greatest number of deaths were from hunger and/or consumption.&nbsp;             
The guards were not as malicious towards the people as the commandant             
himself, a Serbian from the Banat, from Banatski Dvor.&nbsp; He flogged             
everyone that he could, usually in the most painful way.&nbsp; Each             
morning at 4 o’clock the bells rang to signal the livestock feeders;             
they rang later for others but never at consistent times.&nbsp; When             
they did ring, however, everyone had to be there. Then we were divided             
respectively to perform the most diverse and unreasonable tasks.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
On February 15, 1946, it had rained and many people did not show up to             
work.&nbsp; Therefore, several signals rang.&nbsp; As soon as the             
stragglers appeared, however, the commandant himself attacked them with             
numerous slaps, kicks, etc.&nbsp; Then 12 women were separated in order             
to unload food in the neighboring village of Nova Crnja.&nbsp; When             
they arrived, their escort left them to themselves and went into the             
inn in Nova Crnja.&nbsp; So the women returned alone.&nbsp; Partisans             
met them on their way back and instructed them to report to the             
commandant.&nbsp; When they reported to him, the commandant punished             
them by making them do the “Auf und Nieder" <i>["Up and Down” </i></font><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">—</font></i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><i> pushups]</i> in muck and             
water until they were completely drenched and filthy.&nbsp; Of course             
they had no coats beyond what they wore.</font><br>

commandant because on the next day he lined up about 30 women who had             
not reported for work the previous day.&nbsp; He led them to puddles,             
where the water was almost to their knees, and then ordered them to lie             
down in the water.&nbsp; They had to lie there about a half hour,             
without being allowed to rise.&nbsp; This happened on February 16,             
1946, when there was also a frost.&nbsp; Ten of these women then had to             
go to work at Nova Crnja in that condition.</font><br>

On the way back, two women could go no further toward camp and remained             
lying where they were.&nbsp; The next morning they were found             
dead.&nbsp; Their kinswomen were allowed to go find them and return             
them to Molidorf where they were buried.&nbsp; See also the report of             
the camp physician at that time, Dr. Heger, printed under No. 53.&nbsp;             
Here I must admit that in Molidorf, they were not buried in mass             
graves, but the dead were buried individually.&nbsp; There were no             
coffins, but they were put into a bag or old blanket and buried, so             
that the gravesites were level with the ground.</font><br>

On January 27 I was with my neighbor Katharina Köstner on the way to             
Nova Crnja.&nbsp; We wanted to go “moonlight” begging, which was             
strictly forbidden and punishable by arrest, but hunger drove people to             
it again and again . . .&nbsp; So we went out of the camp that night in             
order to be back to work early in the morning.&nbsp; On the way,             
though, Köstner lost her nerve and we turned around halfway.&nbsp; We             
had the misfortune, however, that before we could reach the village, a             
carriage carrying our camp commandant appeared.&nbsp; He abruptly             
stopped the carriage and asked us where we were going.&nbsp; We             
immediately admitted that we had wanted to go begging for bread,             
whereupon my companion said in a somewhat nasty tone that only the             
hungry go begging, that it was not necessary for those who are well             
fed.&nbsp; He sent the carriage away and questioned us repeatedly,             
whether we wanted to run away, etc.&nbsp; I took some steps, Köstner             
trudged wearily behind, next to the commandant.&nbsp; Suddenly I heard             
a sound, turned around and saw that the commandant was repeatedly             
punching her in the head.&nbsp; I continued on my way, heard a shot,             
turned again, and saw that Mrs. Köstner had collapsed from her             
wound.&nbsp; The commandant shouted at me to continue on and commanded             
the woman to rise and go to the camp.</font><br>

then we could have done so much more easily from Zerne.&nbsp;             
Apparently this made sense to him, and he went to Köstner and ordered             
her to come to the camp, which she no longer could do.&nbsp; Then he             
went to the camp with me and locked me up for four days and four nights             
as punishment.</font><br>

Here there were officially no meals, only water was provided.&nbsp; The             
guard, however, took pity on me, brought water heated at the stove,             
gave me a nice piece of bread, and told me that if anyone asked if I             
had eaten, I was to answer no as he had given me the bread against             
orders.&nbsp; From a “Stražar” (guard) I learned that Mrs. Köstner             
groaned the whole night through and towards morning died at the place             
where the commandant had shot her.</font><br>

There were some good, sympathetic men among the guards, but they had to             
be wary of the others.&nbsp; Our commandant was a downright             
brute.&nbsp; I never heard his name.&nbsp; His left foot was a little             
shorter and this deformity seemed to make him want to retaliate against             
us.&nbsp; It was apparent that he delighted in torturing people.</font><br>

On February 16, 1946, 80 women and children were detained because they             
had been begging.&nbsp; The women were from Heufeld, Mastort,             
Werschetz, Molidorf, etc.&nbsp; The village sentries were apparently             
informed that on that day many women would go moonlight begging because             
the women were ambushed as they returned and shot at without             
warning.&nbsp; In one instance, a 65-year old woman from St. Hubert was             
shot and the rest were jailed until the next evening.&nbsp; Towards             
evening the commandant had them all line up and practiced two full             
hours of his popular “Auf-Nieder”, seeking the deepest mud and the             
largest water puddles.&nbsp; After two hours they were released to             
their houses.&nbsp; Obedience did not give way to insubordination on             
this occasion, unlike others, since the guards, armed with automatic             
weapons, would have immediately discouraged any such impulse.</font><br>

when this was confiscated in January and February, along with the             
remaining corn, then our misery became indescribable.&nbsp; Hunger             
drove people so far that they began to catch and eat all the cats in             
the village.&nbsp; When I mentioned once that a cat was wandering             
around near us, someone immediately offered me 30 dinar for it.&nbsp;             
(There were some people, those with outside friends of different             
nationalities, who were secretly supplied with black-market             
money.)&nbsp; It got to the point where you could find no more cats in             
Molidorf.</font><br>

These Auf-und-Nieder” stories and the unbearable hunger led me             
to thoughts of escape.&nbsp; The commandant’s threat that he would lead             
us all into two-meter deep water gave me the final impetus.&nbsp; Also,             
I had snuck into Zerne in November and learned that my husband and my             
daughter were in Linz, Austria.</font><br>

out, but we were silent in order that there would be no questions about             
our escape.</font><br>

the guards were at their nightly meal, and arrived on Romanian soil on             
February 24.&nbsp; There I worked for relatives until the beginning of

28, 1946, the sick and disabled were selected from the camps in order             
to be taken to the camp in Molidorf.&nbsp; Because of my bilious             
complaints, I reported myself sick and also went to Molidorf.&nbsp; The             
elderly and children had already been marched there at Christmas . .

asked, as if on command, if we had brought along salt, since all their             
meals, what little they got, were served without it.&nbsp; We had some

infirmary.&nbsp; I tended the sick in a room where all seven beds were             
constantly occupied.&nbsp; People were mostly ill with consumption and,             
on average, one of the seven died each day.&nbsp; When I came to the             
camp, there were reportedly 6,000 people in the camp.&nbsp; The number             
of dead daily averaged 25 to 30.&nbsp; We had no epidemic, as had             
prevailed before, when the typhoid fever had raged.&nbsp; During the             
typhoid outbreak, most of the victims who died were from Werschetz

The sickroom attendants were ordered to inspect every patient assigned             
to them, but what good was that!&nbsp; In each room they saw humans             
dying.&nbsp; The infirmary was always overcrowded, and we could admit             
no more.&nbsp; In the camp there was also a camp physician, Dr.             
Steiner, a Jew from Zerne.&nbsp; One must admit that he tried to do             
something for the patients, but the possibilities were limited since we             
only had some aspirin, quinine, coal dust for diarrhea, and a skin             
ointment for skin diseases.&nbsp; The usual treatments were cold             
compresses.&nbsp; Today I still do not know whether to laugh or cry,             
because we had to fight nearly every illness with cold             
compresses.&nbsp; Here I would like to mention that Dr. Steiner,

The first German who was killed here was Father Franz Brunet; on             
October 3, 1944, he was taken from the churchyard and shot by the             
partisans for no reason at all.&nbsp; Immediately thereafter, most             
German men were taken from their houses by partisan detachments.&nbsp;             
Many Germans from surrounding villages were also bound and dragged             
here.&nbsp; Also a great number of German women were brought from             
elsewhere to Cernje.&nbsp; The first to be tortured and killed here             
were mostly wealthy women and the more intelligent Germans.&nbsp; After             
the transports arrived here, they were locked up in two large cellars             
and held there for weeks.&nbsp; Usually in the evening hours, groups of             
the elderly from both cellars were taken and abused and tortured in             
every possible way by the partisans.&nbsp; Every partisan or gypsy was             
now allowed to act out his rage, let German blood flow and break the             
ribs of German people, hit them in the teeth or possibly even liquidate             
them.&nbsp; The number of German civilians who never returned from             
those tortures to the others in the cellar is overwhelming.&nbsp; They             
created a corral in Schinderwiese and would pen them there, like             
restrained cattle.&nbsp; Whenever the number of Germans in the cellars             
declined, they brought in new members of both sexes in order to treat             
them the same way as those already killed.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
They were particularly ruthless and vile toward German women.&nbsp;             
They treated them like indescribable animals.&nbsp; One evening, a very             
beautiful woman was among those brought out by the partisans from one             
of the two cellars.&nbsp; For a long time she had to endure every             
possible torture from the partisans.&nbsp; She was forcefully stripped             
naked, and when she still did not submit, hot irons were pressed all             
over her naked body by the lecherous partisans and gypsies.&nbsp; With             
deep skin burns over her whole body, she was then pushed down the             
staircase to the cellar by the partisans.&nbsp; For two whole days this             
woman writhed on the ground in agony while her fellow captives             
watched.&nbsp; Then finally, after two days, she died in the cellar             
from her cutaneous burns.</font><br>

high-spirited, drunken partisans invaded the cellar.&nbsp; Among them             
was a drunken officer with a submachine gun in his hand.&nbsp; All the             
Germans were forced to stand and line up next to each other against the             
cellar wall.&nbsp; The drunken officer then fired haphazardly and             
without cause into the group standing before him.&nbsp; Immediately             
many Germans rolled in their own blood.&nbsp; Some of these, e.g., the             
farmers Anton Kampf and Josef Maier from Zerne, continued to live in             
the cellar for a few days— one who was shot in his lung and the other             
in the knee — without bandages or medical help.&nbsp; Not until October             
12 were they both removed from the cellar and shot.&nbsp; Meanwhile,             
the torturing and individual liquidation of the rest of the Germans             
locked up in the cellar progressed day-by-day, night-by-night without

On Sunday, October 22, all the remaining Germans from Zerne who were             
not yet in the cellars had to dig a large mass grave at             
Schinderplatz.&nbsp; It was 25 meters long, 6 meters wide and 3 meters             
deep.&nbsp; On Tuesday, October 24, the new village authorities made a             
public announcement by drumbeat on the streets of Deutsch-and             
neighboring Serbisch-Zerne that all Germans would be killed.&nbsp; The             
Serbian population and gypsies were invited to come to the             
Schinderplatz to see the Germans publicly massacred.&nbsp; And it was             
on this day, at 2 o’clock in the afternoon, that 174 Germans, including             
50 women, were bound together with wire and led out from the cellars             
where they had been held for weeks under constant abuse and disfigured             
almost beyond recognition.&nbsp; There they were stripped naked and             
shot before a crowd of Serbians and gypsies.&nbsp; The Germans, bound             
in groups, were forced toward the mass grave, shot, and then shoved             
into the grave by partisans.&nbsp; The clothes of the dead were ordered             
by the new authorities to be sent to Zerne by wagon, sorted and             
distributed to Serbian and gypsy population.&nbsp; On the very next day             
these people strutted around wearing the clothes of the slain German             
men and women.</font><br>

the gypsies, now had the authoritative power, right and permission of             
the village to rape and slaughter German women and girls at will.&nbsp;             
Not many Germans chose to wait for defilement and subsequent slaughter             
as announced by the gypsies, especially in view of recent             
circumstances.&nbsp; Therefore, in their despair, on the evening of             
October 24, 1944 in the village of Cernje, no less than 75 decent             
German human beings, mostly women and girls, took their own             
lives.&nbsp; Whole families went voluntarily to their deaths.&nbsp;             
Women threw their small children into wells and jumped in after them,             
other mothers took their children, hung them, and then hung themselves             
alongside.&nbsp; Even the old Mayor Peter Stein and his wife Susanne             
committed suicide.&nbsp; Johann Goldscheck had been killed as             
previously described.&nbsp; His wife and daughter-in-law were raped by             
gypsies in the presence of two of their children.&nbsp; Immediately             
thereafter, all four took their own lives.&nbsp; The wife of Kaspar             
Rothenbach, named Eva, the wife of his son Johann, named Maria, and             
both of their daughters, about 20 and/or 22 years old, were also raped             
by the gypsies.&nbsp; Afterwards, all six committed suicide.&nbsp; They             
hung themselves in a row in the attic of their house.&nbsp; These are             
only some examples.&nbsp; They illustrate and substantiate how the             
monstrous new people’s democratic regime, communist partisans and             
gypsies so atrociously ravaged this village.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
After many more were liquidated in the death cellars of Zerne, where             
new victims arrived almost daily from surrounding villages, those             
remaining in the two cellars were brought out on October 25.&nbsp;             
There were still 480 Germans alive, including 80 women.&nbsp; Again             
they were all tied together with cord and wire and, while being             
constantly taunted and physically abused, were driven by heavily armed             
partisans to the adjoining agricultural property of “Julia             
Major.”&nbsp; From there they were to be assigned to various types of             
heavy hard labor.&nbsp; At every possible opportunity, individually or             
in groups, still more were killed in the cruelest manner.</font><br>

one hundred Germans were shot at one time.&nbsp; Among them were 67             
farmers from the purely German village of Stefansfeld and 33 Germans             
from Pardanj.&nbsp; These shootings were ordered by a Serbian woman, a             
partisan.&nbsp; In 1941 her husband, armed only with a handgun, had             
single-handedly opposed German troops marching into the territory, had             
shot at them and had fallen in battle.&nbsp; So his wife now wanted to             
see the blood flow from one hundred defenseless, unarmed German             
civilians, and she achieved her purpose.</font><br>

Among the German civilians locked up in the cellars were also German             
refugees from Romania and a German prisoner of war officer named Hans             
Konrad from Hatzfeld.&nbsp; This man could not work due to physical             
injuries he had incurred under torture by the partisans.&nbsp; For this             
reason his liquidation was ordered by the partisans.&nbsp; His wife was             
also in the camp.&nbsp; When he was led out to be shot, she left her             
work group and hurried to him.&nbsp; She reached him just before they             
were ready to shoot.&nbsp; She wrapped herself around him and declared             
that she did not want to be parted from him.&nbsp; They were both shot             
at the same time, although they were not Yugoslavian citizens.&nbsp;             
This happened on November 9, 1944.&nbsp; On the same day, eleven             
persons altogether were liquidated.&nbsp; They were mostly the sick and             
those who had become disabled as a result of abusive injuries.&nbsp;             
The order to shoot came from camp commandant Ban. Karadjordjevo.&nbsp;             
He had previously shot numerous Germans in Kikinda and later boasted of             
his actions in “Julia Major.”</font><br>

On a cold New Year’s Eve 1944/45, about midnight, all German camp             
inmates were chased out of their accommodations.&nbsp; First they were             
made to stand and wait for a long idle time in the snow and cold

in the snow for about an hour.&nbsp; Whoever did not push up and down             
fast enough was dreadfully beaten.&nbsp; Even the women had to take             
part in these nightly exercises.&nbsp; A pregnant young German woman             
named Theresia Moll from Tschestelek, the wife of a German officer from             
Romania, was forced, despite her Romanian citizenship and referenced

women.&nbsp; Soon after this punishment, she bore a child who died             
almost immediately.&nbsp; The partisans justified their persecution             
because, on that same New Year’s Eve, the radio had broadcast a speech             
given by a German minister, and for as long as the speech lasted, the             
defenseless German civilians, men and women, should be subjected to             
mass torture.&nbsp; Then, on April 18, 1945, the last Germans who still             
remained there and in the Zerne village on the Lebel were driven out of             
their houses and into the concentration camp.&nbsp; Again in the             
evening of April 19, 22 old people who could no longer work were             
selected, driven away from the camp and shot at Schinderplatz without             
reason or orders, just because they were old and disabled.&nbsp; Often             
during the following days, German women and men were taken out at night             
and killed for no reason.&nbsp; Many young women also continued to             
disappear at night.&nbsp; Most of them are probably buried at the             
Schinderplatz in Zerne.</font><br>

The well-known 1954 Beatus Streitter novel “Nové,” published by the             
Stocker publishing house (Graz), is dedicated “to the memory of the             
girls from Cernje.”&nbsp; It is for the following reasons:&nbsp; In the             
changing days of partisan despotism, indescribable atrocities were             
committed, mostly by gypsies, in the Banat farming village of Zerne             
(Cernje).&nbsp; In order to escape the threatened rapes and continuing             
executions, altogether 75 Zerne residents committed suicide on October             
24, 1944.&nbsp; The account of these events as presented by Rohrbacher             
in his book, “A People Extinguished,” is disputed.&nbsp; What really

The preceding contributions give us a picture of what inhumane             
suffering our people endured at the end of the war and             
afterwards.&nbsp; Hunger, destitution, and death were their constant             
companions.&nbsp; Fiends, robbers, thieves and murderers who were             
driven by hate, revenge, and greed determined their fate.&nbsp;             
Therefore, it soon became clear to our people that there would never be             
good times for them in the homeland again, and their lives could only             
end by lingering illness or violent death.&nbsp; Sick, weak, and             
drained of despair, they now sought a way out, to flee from this hell             
and its minions.&nbsp; There could only be one way, to escape.&nbsp; It             
was a life and death risk.&nbsp; They knew </font><br>

subjected to inhuman tortures or simply shot.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it             
had to be dared!&nbsp; Secretly, they tied their remaining shabby             
belongings into a bundle and waited for a favorable opportunity.&nbsp;             
When the right moment came, they turned their weighty resolution into             
action.&nbsp; With one hand on the bundle and the other on the children             
— provided that the little ones had not been placed in another camp —             
many mothers set out toward the unknown during the night and fog, often             
in extremely cold weather.&nbsp; Their companions were their old, weak             
parents.&nbsp; If they could not travel far into the long journey, they             
had to be left to their fate with a heavy heart.&nbsp; A truly             
harrowing situation!</font><br>

If they reached their first goal, which was to cross the border, they             
could finally sigh with relief, but the unknown future, the fate of             
their beloved spouses, the lot of parents and relatives left behind,             
would not let them rest.&nbsp; Was the husband, the father, still             
alive?&nbsp; Would they ever see each other again?&nbsp; These fearful             
questions remained unanswered.&nbsp; To be taken in by good people,             
perhaps by relatives, allowed momentary relief, but it could not be the             
final solution.&nbsp; Scarcely had the excitement, fear, and shock of             
the past few days subsided, when the demands and obligations of life             
became apparent.&nbsp; They could not allow these people who received             
them to carry the entire burden, so they had to strive to become             
responsible for their own subsistence.&nbsp; Even if they found work             
and could provide for their own needs to at least some extent, they             
were still in constant danger of being traced by the occupation forces             
or authorities of their respective countries, and perhaps even deported             
back to their homeland.&nbsp; The mere thought of it called to mind all             
the martyrdom and suffering, deprivation and harassment.&nbsp; These             
concerns and agitations had no end, driving the fugitives to flee even             
further away.&nbsp; During sleepless nights, all imaginable             
possibilities were pondered, examined, rejected, and then reconsidered,             
until they finally resolved to continue on their way to Austria or             
Germany, where they hoped to find a permanent home.</font><br>

This was a difficult undertaking because their existing means were not             
even enough for the journey, let alone for guides to cross the             
border.&nbsp; Wide distances along the way meant that a few days or             
weeks of rest must be taken during the journey in order to acquire new             
means to travel further.&nbsp; Thus, their last usable belongings and             
valuables — if they still had any — were sacrificed for this             
purpose.&nbsp; If their luck held, they arrived at their destination             
after extreme exertion and privation; however, those who were followed             
by misfortune were often imprisoned for weeks before they reached their             
goal.&nbsp; Those who successfully completed the long, difficult             
journey – and that was ten thousand of our countrymen – landed in a             
camp or on a farm in the country.&nbsp; They were now free from worry             
about living day and night with the fear and anxiety of falling into             
the hands of the minions from Hell.</font><br>

The conditions here were also bad.&nbsp; The countries had been             
devastated by the war, cities lay in rubble and ash, traffic was             
paralyzed.&nbsp; Housing shortages, misery, and lack of all necessities             
also prevailed here.&nbsp; But it must be said, with acceptance and             
gratitude, that the people and public authorities of the countries of             
refuge undertook every effort that was humanly possible to overcome the             
disaster.&nbsp; Local and foreign charitable organizations gradually             
stepped in.&nbsp; Slowly but steadily, order was applied to the chaos             
caused by the war.&nbsp; After years of severe adversity and             
deprivation, improvements began to appear.&nbsp; Life began to             
normalize; by the most diverse connections, they began to contact             
relatives, acquaintances, friends, neighbors, and fellow             
countrymen.&nbsp; They exchanged messages and experiences, became             
acquainted with the fate of their loved ones.&nbsp; The Red Cross and             
various search agencies carried out work that can hardly be             
overlooked.&nbsp; Because of their beneficial operations, many families             
were reunited.&nbsp; They even provided certainty as to the fate of             
prisoners of war, husbands, fathers, and brothers.&nbsp; Meetings of             
village and homeland associations also conveyed this.&nbsp; Many             
received positive, joyful news, but so many others experienced bitter             
disappointment because they had to finally acknowledge the loss

However, life with its inexorable demands, the difficulties of everyday             
life, again surfaced.&nbsp; Everyone expressed the same question and             
concern:&nbsp; How should they face the future?&nbsp; Their prospects             
were only somewhat promising.&nbsp; Where and how could one best             
develop a new livelihood?&nbsp; What can the grown children expect from             
the future?&nbsp; Plans were considered and rejected until they found a             
final resolution.&nbsp; Many saw a future in their country of refuge;             
others considered emigrating overseas where relatives or friends             
encouraged the possibility.&nbsp; Here it should be mentioned that our

Each person has a homeland to be proud of.&nbsp; By a merciless and             
cruel fate, this possession was taken from us.&nbsp; There were two             
peoples who questioned our right of domicile and made it a contentious             
matter in the course of history:&nbsp; Hungarians and Serbians.&nbsp;             
Were they right?</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In the ninth century, Hungarians took possession of the country within             
the area of the Carpathians.&nbsp; They were a warlike people who             
undertook looting expeditions into neighboring nations, attacked and             
robbed them, and returned home enriched with their booty.&nbsp; In the             
beginning, the attacked were no match for the lightning raids of these             
horsemen.&nbsp; However, there soon came a time when neighboring             
peoples — particularly Germans — taught them to successfully defend             
themselves and inflict devastating defeats.&nbsp; Thus the Hungarians             
came to deliberate and gradually adapt to their neighbors’ way of life,             
and were converted to Christianity.&nbsp; Along with Christianity they             
were gradually introduced to the western way of life.&nbsp; Soon their             
first king, Stefan the Holy, invited Germans to his country.&nbsp;             
There should be people with different trades and occidental cultures             
introduced.&nbsp; His wife was Gisela, a Bavarian princess, who fully             
supported and encouraged him.&nbsp; Their people came under the sphere             
of western peoples.&nbsp; Several times in the course of Hungarian             
history (Géza II, Béla IV), German settlers were invited to the country             
to train the people in various trades (mining industry) and             
handicrafts.&nbsp; It was Germans who built the first cities and             
administered them according to the laws of their native towns.&nbsp;             
The kings conferred special rights and privileges to them, which made             
it possible for them to lead lives just as in their motherland.&nbsp;             
In this way, they became the instructors of the Hungarian people             
(Zipser, Siebenbürg Saxons).&nbsp; In the year 1526 the Hungarian army             
was totally destroyed by the Turks at Mohács.&nbsp; King Ludwig II,             
most of the aristocracy, and the upper ranks of the clergy were killed             
on the battlefield.&nbsp; The remaining nobility was divided after the             
dreadful event and selected two kings, a Hungarian and the Hapsburger             
Ferdinand.&nbsp; While inner conflicts ravaged the country, the Turks             
conquered nearly all of Hungary and advanced to Vienna.&nbsp; The             
entire Western civilization and Christianity along with it were             
endangered.&nbsp; In the crucial battle at Vienna (1683), the Turks             
were defeated and eventually forced out of Hungary.&nbsp; Who freed             
this country?&nbsp; It was German armies under the supreme command of             
Prince Eugen, by order of its emperor and the king of Hungary,&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font></div>

only a small fraction of them followed the liberating army.&nbsp;             
Settlement of the country followed the liberation.&nbsp; After enduring             
nearly two hundred years of Turkish rule, there was no             
population.&nbsp; Germans were again mainly consulted.&nbsp; The short             
history of settlement can be reread in other places; in the old Banater             
language, it can be summarized:&nbsp; “The first found death, the             
second fought adversity, only the third had bread.”</font><br>

Initially after settlement, the territory remained under the protection             
of the emperor.&nbsp; After compromising with the Hungarians, it was             
annexed to Hungary.&nbsp; As long as the Banat was under the protection             
of the emperor, our national security ensured that special rights were             
bestowed on us since our settlement was actually just a part of the             
resettlement from the western portion of the emperor’s domain into the             
eastern part.&nbsp; With the advent of the compromise with Hungary,             
however, we were claimed by political cunning.&nbsp; We were simply             
sacrificed and forgotten in the large scheme of things.</font><br>

who one might expect to know of our existence — were joyfully surprised             
and astonished to find flourishing German cities and villages             
here.&nbsp; Unfortunately for us, that was a sad but true

The Treaty of Versailles terminated the first World War.&nbsp; This was             
a treaty dictated out of blindness and hatred that by its very terms

economically (EWG), but also politically, so that it may then become a             
native country for many peoples.&nbsp; Is that not what Austria-Hungary             
was, and was not our Banat a small image of Austria-Hungary?&nbsp; Only             
foolishness could shatter it and replace it with the rule of such             
people who had never played a significant political role in the course

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At             
the end of World War I, our fate was handed over to Serbia, who could             
exist only with the support of Russia and France, and today Yugoslavia             
also exists in such a way that, depending upon the political climate,             
it now borrows from the East, then from the West.&nbsp; The political             
megalomania of these people, who were the direct cause for the outbreak             
of World War I, can never provide historical grounds to claim our             
presence in the Banat as illegal because of the special autonomous             
rights we possess, conferred by German emperors as well as Hungarian

      <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At             
the beginning of their exercise of power, the Serbians presided with             
mildness.&nbsp; They approved our mother tongue as the language of             
instruction in the schools, and a Culture League was approved, even             
promoted.&nbsp; That served the purpose, however, of </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">separating the Germans&nbsp;</font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> </font></div>

a minority in the Banat.&nbsp; As long as these two lived in discord,             
the Serbians had time to stabilize conditions.&nbsp; The first warning             
signs of what the Serbians intended for us were at the peace             
talks.&nbsp; They wanted to have the territory assigned to them, but             
probably not the population.&nbsp; That was not successful for them,             
but their plan continued to exist.&nbsp; After the peace treaty was             
signed, they gradually changed their behavior, and their insidious game             
openly came to light.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In the cause of agrarian reform, they expropriated the <i>[Csekonics]</i>             
estate on which thousands of minority families (German, Hungarian,             
etc.) earned their means of livelihood.&nbsp; This was exclusively             
distributed to Serbian war volunteers (Dobrovoljacen) and other             
Serbians.&nbsp; Thus, the livelihood for the families of national             
minorities was eliminated , and the Serbian element was strengthened.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
The second measure was to remove the expert and proven civil servants             
from Hungarian times and replace them with their people, who had no             
basic technical knowledge.&nbsp; The few old officials who were left in             
their positions were allowed to do their work, but the new people spied             
on them, denounced them, exploited them, and campaigned for the             
governing party in each case, whereby they need not hesitate to use             
threats and harassment.&nbsp; Police were even emplaced to aid the             
oppression.</font><br>

      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Culture League, which they had authorized, was dissolved             
immediately, its property was seized, and its leaders were incredibly             
tormented.&nbsp; German delegates were even flogged on their way             
through the Serbian mob to vote, their meetings disrupted and             
dissolved.&nbsp; Their delegates issued an insulting speech             
prohibition.&nbsp; On election days they broke the windows of the             
German populace.&nbsp; Conditions were particularly bad in villages of

After the occupation, the mother tongue was introduced to the schools             
as the language of instruction.&nbsp; It did not, however, last very             
long, and gradually everything was changed.&nbsp; It got to the point             
that the second grade was required to learn the subject of national             
language, starting in the third grade a number of national topics             
(history, geography) had to also be taught in Serbisch, and by the end             
of the fourth school year, the children had to be able to write German             
in Gothic and Latin script, Serbian in Cyrillic and Latin script.&nbsp;             
It is not difficult to imagine what became of that!&nbsp; Our political             
leaders demanded that school autonomy be granted to us, which was             
rejected with indignation.&nbsp; In Hungarian times, this right was             
also granted to the Serbians, yet they were always trumpeting to the             
world how the Hungarians oppressed them.&nbsp; As a result of its             
public education, a flourishing Serbisch culture and literature             
developed.&nbsp; Their culture organization “Matica srpska” was not             
hindered from developing active and expressive cultural works and             
education, as appears in its annals.&nbsp; Their seat was in Neusatz             
(Novi Sad), which is why this city is also called Serbian Athens.&nbsp;             
The path to public service was also barred to Germans or members of             
other national minorities.&nbsp; Nevertheless, in the rare instances             
when they succeeded, they could only get subordinate positions, and not             
responsible or leadership posts.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
In order to withstand the areas of economic strain, we were forced to             
create pecuniary institutions, like Agraria, a central credit bank and             
other branch organizations, which excited new distrust and became             
another stumbling block.</font><br>             
      </div>
      <div align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;             
The diligence and economic efficiency of our people, which are usually             
considered human virtues and which lead to material prosperity, instead             
provoked envy and hatred, and were, to the Serbians’ way of thinking,             
increasingly aroused in public places, often even in front of the             
church.</font><br>

The constant pressure to which we were exposed finally resulted in             
counter-pressure.&nbsp; Thus emerged a modernization movement, which             
created discord within our own ethnic group, but its very appearance,             
marching music, parades, had a tendency to create ill will among the             
Serbians, and caused ever more dangerous threats.&nbsp; Then when the             
war broke out, hundreds of hostages were kidnapped — no doubt could             
exist about their final fate — </font><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">and the wave of terror that

any wonder then that we Germans met the appearance of German troops             
with thankful relief, because they had freed us from the increasing             
pressures and harassment.&nbsp; We had no clear idea of what political             
conditions and efforts were in the realm, and what we tried to imagine,

After the occupation, a police force of able-bodied Germans was trained             
to maintain order and security, whose assembly aroused no             
suspicion.&nbsp; As it was when the “Prince Eugen” division was formed,             
this was met with mixed feelings, but their deployment into the Serbian             
area was the biggest mistake that the German leadership could have             
made.&nbsp; We thereby increased the pretext to label us as traitors,             
and the hatred from the opposition was immeasurable, which finally led             
to the annihilation of our people.&nbsp; That our escape was prevented             
— for which our peoples’ group leadership was also guilty — increased             
the extent of the disaster, for then more than a third of our people

There are various reasons why our history of so many years ended             
tragically.&nbsp; The national consciousness of people, awakened toward             
the end of the last century <i>[19th]</i>, led to rampant chauvinism,             
which             
soon became a great danger for our people.&nbsp; While this attitude             
slowly became the common mindset of other people and affected and             
dictated their actions, our people remained virtually unaffected by             
it.&nbsp; When we finally became aware of the danger that threatened             
us, it was too late.&nbsp; By the cunning alienation of our             
intelligence by the Magyars, by nearly completely banishing our mother             
tongue from the schools, and with their success at putting our             
nationality consciousness to sleep, our people suffered an irreparable             
loss of assets, including enforced widespread birth control.&nbsp;             
During the shrewd introduction of Magyar dominance over us, the Slavics             
tried to brutally annihilate us.&nbsp; Through the panslavic movement,             
through their secret society, the Sokol, through chicaneries and             
aggressions of every kind, through the denial of our rights, we </font><br>
